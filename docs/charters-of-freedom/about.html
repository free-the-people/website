<h1>The Charters of Freedom</h1>

<p>The three founding documents of the United States are collectively known as the <i>Charters of Freedom,</i> and form the basis of our national identity.</p>

</h4>
<p>The Declaration of Independence was adopted in 1776, and is the foundational document of the United States. This document outlined the justification for declaring the thirteen British colonies in the Americas free of British rule and entitled to rule themselves. This decision was not made lightly, and many attempts were made to redress the grievances the colonists had against King George and Great Britain. When their efforts yielded no results, the colonies together declared that Great Britain no longer had the right to rule over them, and declared their independence.</p>

    The Bill of Rights
</h4>
<p>The Bill of Rights is not a completely separate document. Instead, it is a collection of the first ten ammendments to the United States Constitution. Together, these ammendments outline the rights of the people of the United States of America. Collectively, these ammendments outline the central role individual rights play in the principles of this nation.</p>
