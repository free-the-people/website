<h4>Conservative, not Republican</h4>

<p>I was once a registered Republican. In fact, for most of my life, I took pride in that little R by my name, representing my party affiliation. In 2008, I officially changed my party affiliation to "Unaffiliated" for two reasons: First, I felt that the Republican Party was not adequately representing my political values, and second (and a direct result of the first reason), I wanted to be able to vote in <i>either</i> party's primary election. It's worth noting that I'm only talking about the presidential elections in this article because, like so many Americans, I don't really participate in elections at the local level. That's a huge problem in American politics, and one I admit to contributing to. But that's the subject for another article at another time. For now, right or wrong, I will just focus on my experiences with the presidential elections over the past several decades.</p>

<p>My political views, though they've changed over the years as I've changed and matured, can best be classified as "conservative." The things that mattered most to me were, and still are, respect for the Constitution and the rule of law, leading with integrity, fiscal responsibility, patriotism, and the freedom of the people. When I was younger, that meant I voted Republican. I saw the Republican Party as the party that honored and valued our constitutional principles and maintained the freedom of the people, while I saw the Democratic Party as the party that was willing to compromise any of their values to ride the wave of popular opinion. That bias was relatively strong in me, and I'm not sure where it came from exactly. I was very wrong about the Republican Party, but I'm not yet convinced that I was wrong in my assessment of the Democratic Party.</p>

<p>For most of my adult life, I only focused on what I was seeing in the Republican Party, which I assumed was representing my own conservative political values. And what I was seeing was a gradual move away from conservative values and into extreme right-wing politics. I used to think those were the same thing, since the term "right-wing" is often used interchangeably with "conservative" by most people and by the media. Both views are positioned to the right of the political spectrum, but the difference is in degree, with conservatives lying slightly to the right of center, and "right-wingers" moving farther and farther to the right with every passing year. These terms should not be used interchangeably. Both conservatives and right-wingers support free markets, but conservatives are far more likely to support social safety nets, sensible government regulations, and worker protections. Right-wingers, on the other hand, will advocate for de-regulation and support corporate profitability over worker support. Conservatives want to protect traditional values and social order, but right-wingers take an extremist view and vilify immigrants and "foreign" ideologies. Conservatives defend family and community ties, while right-wingers emphasize ethnic, religious, or national identity over other ties. Conservatives align their political views with their values and beliefs, while right-wingers have no values and only care about opposing "the radical left."</p>

<p>Today, the Republican Party has completely abandoned conservative values in favor of right-wing extremism. I've noticed this trend for nearly 20 years now, but it was during Donald Trump's first term in office that the Republican Party accelerated its move to the right, dropping any pretense of adherence to conservative policies. When Trump was selected as the party's nominee early in 2016, the vast majority of Republicans distanced themselves from him and his policies, claiming that Trump did not represent them, their values, or their constituents. But over the next four years, the entire party capitulated and transformed itself into the Trump loyalist party, abandoning any political ideology in favor of blind fealty. The shift did not happen by a replacement of conservative party members with Trump loyalists. While a few have been ousted for disagreeing with the party rhetoric, most of the players are the same. It's just their politics that have changed. I was (and still am) shocked to see so many lifelong politicians so quickly and completely abandon their so-called political ideals to embrace blind loyalty to a man who openly defiles everything they once believed in. Their lack of integrity is beyond my comprehension, and represents a complete and total betrayal of their constituents and their country. I, for one, will <b>never</b> vote for a Republican for any position in government ever again.</p>

<p>But that leaves me in a bit of a bind. I refuse to support any Republicans, but that leaves only one real choice. I need to vote for Democrats, even though they do not represent my conservative values. Aside from the left-wing extremists, most Democrats are politically closer to my conservative values than the right-wing extremists in the Republican Party, so I can vote for them with a clean conscious, even while wishing there was a better alternative. Sure, there are other political parties, but they do not have enough support to challenge the dominant political parties. The most significant election in our country is always the presidential election, and the minor parties are generally excluded from election coverage completely. There are many reasons for that, but the most significant is the high bar set by the mainstream media for political coverage. Candidates have to have fairly strong support in the national polls and raise a massive amount of money through campaign contributions before they are even allowed to be represented, even in coverage of the primary races. For a candidate who is running for one of the mainstream parties, their party affiliation automatically wins them public support, and helps them raise money. But minor party candidates don't see these benefits. While there are some sound reasons for setting these bars, the problem with it is obvious: How can a minor-party candidate do well in the polls or raise a lot of money if they aren't represented by the media?</p>

<p>So, for all intents and purposes, Americans are left with only two choices for president: One Democrat and one Republican.</p>

<h4>What can we do?</h4>

<p>While I am willing to vote for some Democrats these days because I have grown to despise the Republican Party, that's not true for all conservatives. For some, the correlation between "conservative" and "Republican" is so strong that they would never even consider voting for a Democrat, no matter how extreme the Republican Party gets. For others, their religious leaders have used their pulpits to spread the lie that Christianity teaches conservative or even right-wing values (it doesn't) and that conservative values are represented by the Republican Party (they aren't). For the rest, the tendency to use the terms "conservative," "Republican," and "right-wing" interchangeably makes them feel like voting for a Democrat would involve compromising their values, and, in some cases, their religion. That's how we end up with so many conservatives voting for a candidate that doesn't represent conservative values at all.</p>

<p>That doesn't leave conservatives with many practical choices. I can make a few suggestions for what you can do if you identify as a conservative, but not a right-wing extremist. Individually, none of these will make a significant impact. But, perhaps, if enough people take some of these steps, it might just pave the way for a viable new political party for a new breed of conservative candidates.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p><b>Change your voter registration immediately</b><br/>
The very first thing you can and should do, as soon as possible, is change your voter registration. If you are a conservative, I don't think you will want to affiliate with the Democratic Party, and there probably aren't any existing alternative parties that are going to really represent your values, so I suggest you change your registration to "unaffiliated."</p>

<p>This allows you to have a clear conscience and not feel like you've compromised your values. It also sends a message to Republicans that their position is not as secure as they think it is. When Donald Trump was elected, he claimed that he had a "mandate" from the people to dismantle the Constitution and destroy our democracy. That was never true, of course, but being elected to a second term has certainly emboldened him to become more extreme than ever. It's unlikely that anything can be done about Donald Trump, but his actions require support from Republicans in Congress, and if these Republicans see the number of registered Republicans in their home districts dwindling, they may be less supportive of Donald Trump in the future.</p>

<p>As an added benefit, if you register as an independent, many states will allow you to vote in the primaries of either party (not both...you can only vote in one). This gives you a small voice in the choice for the Democratic candidate, so you can support a candidate who is either closer to your political values, or at least not openly antagonistic towards them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Stop voting for Republicans</b><br/>
If you are a conservative, you have to stop voting for Republicans. Completely. Never vote for a Republican again, in any election.</p>
 
<p>This is unfortunate, but it's very true. Many Republican candidates, particularly on the local level, are still trying to pass themselves off as "one of the good Republicans." They want you to believe that they still hold conservative values, and have not adopted an extremist position. They probably aren't lying...they probably do believe that. Regardless of what they belive and in light of everything that has happened over the last decade, but most importantly over the last few months, it's no longer possible to be a conservative <i>and</i> a Republican. I'm sure many Nazis joined the party because they were patriots who wanted to see Germany flourish. But once it became apparent that the Nazi party was more interested in advancing its own political agenda than in supporting actual Germans, people had to make a choice between loyalty to their party, and doing the right thing. In the end, there were no good Nazis.</p>

<p>The Republican Party in the United States has reached that point. The party's clearly-stated agenda is anti-constitutional, defies the rule of law and the separation of powers, and denies the fundamental rights of the people. It openly stands against everything this country was founded to be. For this reason, it is not possible to support the Republican Party and claim to be either a conservative or a patriot (Or a Christian, but that's completely beyond the scope of this article).</p>

<p>The time has come for any registered Republicans to choose between loyalty to your party and loyalty to the principles upon which the nation was founded. You simply cannot be loyal to both.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Call your Republican representative and tell them</b><br/>
Changing your party affiliation and refusing to vote for Republicans are both great, and send a powerful message. But if you live in a Republican-held state or district, you can really drive the point home by calling your Republican representative(s) and telling them why you are changing your voter affiliation.</p>

<p>Make it clear to them that you don't see a path forward for the Republican Party as a whole, and that their capitulation to Donald Trump has disgusted you enough that you are leaving the party behind.</p>

<p>And just to be sure that the message is clear: Let them know that you will <i>never</i> vote for a republican again because their party has betrayed the people it represents.</p>
</li>
<li><p><b>Let the world know that you are leaving and why</b><br/>
Post your decision to leave the Republican Party on social media. Write an op-ed in your local paper or on your blog (if you have one) about your choice. Talk to your friends and family about your decision, and let them know why you made it. Don't just say it once. Keep repeating it until it becomes part of your identity.</p>

<p>Conservatives should make a point to join in the protests taking place around the country. Stand up and make your voice heard, and let the Republicans know that they don't have your support.</p>

<p>It's also important to let the other protesters, the media, and the world see that the protesters and Trump's opposition are not just Democrats. When you join the protests, make it clear that you are not a Democrat. Carry a sign that identifies you as a "Conservative against the Republican Party," or something along those lines. Talk to people and let them know you are there <i>because</i> you are a conservative.</p>

<p>Your reception may vary, depending on where you live. I come from a purple state, and I feel very comfortable joining a protest and telling people I'm a conservative, but not a Republican. But the reaction you get may be different, depending on your state and the people around you. Keep yourself safe...don't antagonize anyone who won't accept your views, and don't start a fight with anyone. But if you can do so safely, let them know you are not a Democrat. It might just open a few eyes on both sides of the political divide.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Be proud of your decision</b><br/>
The two parties have largely defined themselves lately as the opposite of one another, rather than a party representing a political ideology. To be a Republican means to oppose Democrats, and to be a Democrat means to oppose Republicans. If you leave the Republican Party or have the audacity to vote for a Democrat, people may try to make you feel like you are abandoning your principles. Or they'll try to make it personal, and say you are abandoning your people, your religion, or your traditions.</p>

<p>But the opposite is true: You are leaving the Republican Party <i>because of</i> your political values, your ideals, your traditions, and (for some) your religion. You are standing up for what you believe in, and that's something you should be proud of.</p>
</li>

<h4>Appendix: Conservatives vs. Republicans</h4>

<p>It wouldn't be fair to accuse the Republican Party of abandoning conservative values without taking some time to talk about what those values are. To my knowledge, there is no <i>official</i> definition of what it means to be a conservative, politically, so I just turned to ChatGPT to generate a set of basic values that are commonly understood to be "conservative." The list is not exhaustive by any means, nor is it inerrant. It's just a starting point for the conversation.</p>

<p>The list below offers some of the core conservative values, along with a brief description of what that value means. For each value statement, I am providing my opinions about how a conservative might respond to these values and how a Republican (which I am now using as synonymous with a right-wing extremist) might respond to illustrate the difference. These are my own opinions, and may not reflect the general view of those who consider themselves to be conservatives or Republicans.</p>
