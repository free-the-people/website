<p>On February 20, 2025, Donald Trump tried to distract reporters asking for information about what, specifically, DOGE was looking at by saying, <b>"We're going to go into Fort Knox to make sure the gold is there. You know that? We're going to go into Fort Knox? Do you know about that?"</b> When the reporter tried to get him back on topic, he doubled down and said, <b>"We do want to look. I mean, we hope everything's fine with Fort Knox, but we're going to go to Fort Knox, the fabled Fort Knox, and make sure the gold is there."</b></p>

<p>Another reporter asked the only logical question: "Where would the gold have gone?"</p>

<p>Trump's reply: "If the gold isn't there, we're going to be very upset."</p>

<p>Most reporters, commentators, and citizens discussing this have dismissed his comments as just a distraction to divert attention from the way DOGE is mangling our country. Maybe that's all this is—a distraction. But we, at <b>free-the-people.us,</b> are concerned that this may be something more serious.</p>

<p>Donald Trump is a complete imbecile. He is the bumbling, mumbling village idiot who out-idiots every other idiot in the history of...well, history. I can't emphasize this enough, though if you're reading this, I probably don't need to convince you. But, "this must be distinctly understood, or nothing wonderful can come of the story I am going to relate." (Charles Dickens, <i>A Christmas Carol,</i> <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/46/46-h/46-h.htm#link1" target="_blank">Stave One</a>).</p>

<p>In addition to being off-the-charts stupid, Donnie is also extremely narcissistic. And he thinks he's clever and tricky. This is a very unusual combination, and it's part of what makes him so infuriating. But it's also the key to understanding him.</p>

<p>What happens when an idiot who craves praise and adoration feels like he's being snubbed? He will say or do anything he can think of to trick people into ooh-ing and aah-ing over him again. In this case, he thinks he can get people to stop questioning him and instead be amazed by saying, "We're going to Fort Knox to see if the gold is there!"</p>

<p>And it worked—sort of. Instead of asking him to justify DOGE's unprecedented infringement on the Constitution and the rights of the American people, reporters were suddenly pressing him for more details about his newest revelation. Suddenly, he feels like he's the president again, and (in his mind) he knows everything while the press has to beg him for his tasty little secret.</p>

<p>We've seen this before. Every time it happens, the reaction is the same: we brush it off as Donnie throwing a tantrum to divert attention from the real issue. And it works, time and time again. The press takes the bait and starts asking all the wrong questions. Meanwhile, the public argues about it for days on social media, and the original issue quietly fades into the background, all but forgotten.</p>

<p>But sometimes, the sheer buffoonery of Donnie's claims gives us a peek into the future that he (or, more accurately, his puppeteers) have planned for us.</p>

<p>Remember back in 2020 when, months before the election, Trump started the unsubstantiated rumor that mail-in voting was insecure and vulnerable to massive fraud? The following clip was recorded in May 2020—six months before the election:</p>

<blockquote class="indent">

<p>He also repeatedly stated, months before the election, that he would not accept the results if he lost. He went even further, claiming that if he lost, it would mean the election was rigged against him (September 24, 2020, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2020-54274115" target="_blank">BBC News</a>). In one interview, his lack of self-control betrayed him, and he blurted out, "Get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very peaceful—there won't be a transfer, frankly. There will be a continuation." His grammar is barely coherent, but the message is clear: If it weren't for those pesky voters, he could just stay in power.</p>

<p>On Election Day, before enough votes were counted to predict a winner, he started claiming both that the election was a fraud <i>and</i> that he had won—despite the fact that no results had been finalized until three days later.</p>

<p><b>Pay attention to this:</b> For months before the 2020 election, Donnie was pushing the idea of voter fraud. And when he lost? Guess what&mdash;he blamed voter fraud.</p>

<p>This was not an isolated incident. How many times during his 2024 campaign did Donnie say he would be a "dictator on day one"? This outrageous claim shocked and appalled many Americans. And what happened? Was he, in fact, a dictator on day one? Of course he was. By the way, he never said he would stop being a dictator on day two—just that he would be one on day one.</p>

<p>This is yet another example of Donnie announcing ahead of time that he is about to do something shocking and unprecedented—then doing it. Several times on the campaign trail, Donnie told his rally crowds either that this would be the last election they'd ever need to vote in or that he already had "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfisOF5XJdg&t=43s" target="_blank">plenty of votes</a>"—before the polls even opened. And, in a shocking turn of events, he had plenty of votes to win. Coincidence? I think not.</p>

<p>And neither does he, as he revealed (probably accidentally) on January 19, 2025, when he said, <b>"And then [Elon Musk] journeyed to Pennsylvania, where he spent like a month and a half campaigning for me in Pennsylvania. And he's a popular guy. And he was very effective, and he knows those computers better than anybody. All those computers, those vote-counting computers. And we ended up winning Pennsylvania like in a landslide."</b></p>

</blockquote>

<p>Once again, Donnie openly announced what he was going to do—rig the election system so you "won't have to vote again"—and then, apparently, he did it.</p>

<p>That's why his seemingly irrelevant statement about going to Fort Knox is so concerning. While conspiracy theories about Fort Knox being empty have circulated for years, the facility is one of the most secure in the country and is regularly audited to confirm that the gold is where it belongs. No other president has ever suggested that they need to personally inspect it.</p>

<p>And Donnie didn't just announce he was going—he also made sure to say that if the gold wasn't there, he would be "very upset."</p>

<p>Given his history, I think we should take this seriously. He will go to Fort Knox—probably with Elon Musk. That's right: the richest man in the world, inside a building housing more than half of all the federal government's gold reserves.</p>

<p>Let's spell this out: Donnie is taking a kid with the world's worst sweet tooth into a candy store. I wonder what will happen?</p>

<p>Or do I? Because Donnie has already told us what will happen. "If the gold isn't there, we're going to be very upset." And I suspect that's exactly what they'll find—some, or worse, all of the gold will be "missing."</p>

<p>Naturally, they'll blame Joe Biden or the Democratic party as a whole, offering no evidence. There probably won't be any conclusive evidence that there was any foul play at all, just vague claims that there is missing gold. Yet somehow, in some mysterious way, both Trump and Musk's net worth will tick up by a few more billion dollars, along with their most loyal Republican bootlickers. Maybe a few Democrats will even "spontaneously" switch parties.</p>

<p>And the kicker? Despite a convicted felon escorting the world's greediest man into a treasure vault, when it turns up empty (or less full than it should be), they won't be charged, won't be prosecuted, and won't face consequences.</p>

<p>I hope I'm wrong. But Donnie has used this same tactic over and over, and I think it's time we start paying attention.</p>
