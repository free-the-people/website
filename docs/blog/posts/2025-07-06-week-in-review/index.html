			<p>New intelligence reports reinforce the picture that U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites were not as destructive as originally claimed. Donny 2-Dolls initially reported that the operation had "completely and totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program. But for the past week, some intelligence sources have indicated that the damage may not have been as devastating as claimed.</p>
			<p>There's no doubt that the three targeted facilities were heavily damaged. The question is how effective they were in ending Iran's nuclear weapon development. Several factors play into that, including having proper facilities and equipment necessary to properly enrich uranium. Those facilities have been damaged, but the extent of the damage is unknown. What is also unknown is whether some or all of the uranium being enriched may have been moved to another facility. We also know that bombs do not destroy knowledge, and there is no doubt that the knowledge of how to enrich uranium has not been removed from Iran.</p>

        <p>Authoritarianism feeds on its own power, meaning that the longer a dictator holds power over the people, the stronger they become. This makes the dictator more dangerous as time goes on, and Trump is no exception. Every day, he grows bolder in acting out his agenda with mass deportations, denial of civil rights, and weaponizing the courts. The only way he can be stopped is by the people rising against him.</p>
        <p>We've shown our disfavor of the Trump regime, especially with the powerful contrast between the lackluster attendance at Trump's birthday parade and the crowds pouring out to demonstrate against him on No King's Day. This is good, and we need to continue to demonstrate our disapproval. But it's not enough.</p>
        <p>Now, it is time to organize a strategic nationwide effort to practice daily resistance efforts coordinated to deter, delay, and defy these authoritarian assaults on our liberty. Indivisible's three-part training will explain how coordinated strategic action can affect even a powerful dictator, how we can grow the movement by bringing the teachings to our own communities, and how we can coordinate our local efforts with the national movement.</p>

			<p>While she was the acting governor of South Dakota, Cosplay Barbie Kristi Noem was pocketing dark money donations to her political campaign. She pocketed $80,000 in 2023, 20% more than the average American worker earns in a year, and this was what she was illegally taking <i>on top of</i> her government salary of $130,000 a year.</p>
			<p>Most politicians regularly raise money for their campaigns, but no one is allowed to use such campaign donations for their own personal use. Government employees are supposed to be civil servants, but it's hard to imagine anyone calling themselves a "servant" while bringing in 3x the average American worker's income in a year, especially when they are stealing almost 40% of that income. Noem was also required to report the sources of her income from 2023 on when she was appointed to the position of Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. She did not report the stolen money as part of her income.</p>

        <p>Elon Musk, who was once largely seen as a prominent and well-respected visionary, has fallen from favor in the public's eye for his involvement in DOGE's work in dismantling our democracy.</p>
        <p>For some reason, he thinks people will forget that he is an enemy of the people and will rush out and vote for candidates in this new so-called "America Party."</p>
        <p>Of course, starting a political party is not as easy as just buying a candidate as he did successfully with Trump and failed to do with Brad Schimel in Wisconsin's April Supreme Court election.</p>
        <p>It's hard to imagine that one of the most hated political figures of our time (next to Donald Trump himself) is daft enough to think he has a future in politics. Time will tell, and money does have a way of changing things. So it's possible Musk can spend enough to grease the wheels of his new party, but I'm willing to bet this party never comes close to upsetting the current system.</p>

            <p class="caption">American Dictator Donny 2-Dolls delivers rambling address on June 26, urging his army of bootlickers to pass the "One, Big Beautiful Bill." The bill passed and was signed into law on July 4, 2025.</p>
        </div>
        <p>On July 4, 249 years after the founders of the United States of America signed its Declaration of Independence from the tyranny of King George III, a new tyrant stood on on a balcony high above the peons watching below to deliver an incoherent and rambling address of no substance or value, which the hand-picked "crowd" of sycophants and bootlickers dutifully applauded.</p>
        <p>The purpose of the event? To commemorate the signing of the "Big Beautiful Bill," whose idiotic name appropriately reflects the intellect of its authors, into law. This bill is arguably one of the worst pieces of legislation ever passed by Congress. The bill is a budget reconciliation bill that primarily focuses on providing permanent tax breaks to the most wealthy people in the country at a cost of approximately $5 trillion. These tax breaks will be partially paid for by decreasing Medicaid coverage by making it harder for individuals to qualify, making states pay for more of it, cutting food assistance for struggling families, cutting student loan programs, and eliminating tax credits for green energy.</p>
        <p>The bill also adds $171 billion in funding for ICE, making it the largest law enforcement agency in the United States. Big businesses, especially pharmaceutical companies, oil and gas extractors, defense contractors, private prisons, and gun manufacturers stand to benefit significantly from the bill, while there are no provisions that offer any benefits to average working Americans.</p>
        <p>It's interesting that the "crowd" observing the event was not shown by the media, which is not surprising after hearing the applause and cheers from what must have been a small and unenthusiastic gathering, at best.</p>

<h4>What did I/we do last week?</h4>
	<div class="blob">
    <div class="blob-title">
        I'm back...sort of
    </div>
    <div class="blob-content">
        <div class="image-right" style="width:225px">
            <img src="/assets/images/phoenix-flag.jpg" style="width:200px;border-radius:3px" alt="Phoenix Rising" class="img-link">
            <p class="caption">We're updating our look with a new logo representing a new direction.</p>
            <p class="caption">Like a phoenix rising from the ashes of its own dissolution, America will rise again!</p>
        </div>
        <p>It's been a long time since I last published a <a href="/blog/">blog post</a> (My last post was on <a href="/blog/posts/2025-05-18-week-in-review/">May 18</a>). I had a significant change to my schedule, and the majority of the time I previously spent doom-scrolling to prepare these posts has disappeared. It's been difficult to get back on track, but after this disastrous week of news, I felt I needed to put something together. Hopefully I'll be able to keep up the momentum and continue posting these updates as well as writing some new articles, which was the original intent of this website and this social media account.</p>
        <p>Since my last post, I've been working on a new logo idea. My <a href="/articles/disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america">old logo</a> was intended to represent the shame and disgrace I felt for my country as the Trump regime began to systematically dismantle our democracy. But over the past few months, it's become clear that, while I am still deeply ashamed of my country, I need to focus on a path forward, rather than lamenting the current state of affairs.</p>
        <p>I discussed this with my spouse about a month ago, and we both agreed that we need some sort of symbol to unify people against the Trump regime. People are already coming out in droves to protest, so the people are showing up, they are ready, and they are angry. But they are all there for different causes. Some come to defend immigrants from brutal ICE kidnappings and deportation without due process. Others come to support LGBTQ+ rights. Some come to object to the systematic dismantling of our institutions of democracy by DOGE and other destructive elements of the current regime. Others gather to demand an end to the genocide in Gaza or to support Ukraine in their fight for freedom from the Russian invasion. Some come to protect the women's rights, workers' rights, voter's rights, etc.</p>
        <p>There are hundreds of causes that bring people out to stand up to tyranny, and that's a good thing. In fact, that's a very American thing. The United States of America has always been a diverse nation, filled with people from many backgrounds, many races, many religions, and many ideologies. So nothing is more American than having a wide variety of ideals that we hold. But we felt that the country as a whole was lacking a unifying symbol that could tie together all of these diverse viewpoints under a single symbol of resistance. We do not aim to replace the current symbols that are seen at protests and rallies around the country, like the Black Lives Matter flag, the LGBTQ+ pride flag, or flags from Mexico, Palestine, or Ukraine or the American flag, often flown upside down to represent a nation in distress. But we'd like to see people adopt a uniform symbol <i>alongside</i> the current symbols. Something that says, "we're all in this together."</p>
        <p>Together, we thought that a <b>phoenix</b> might be a good symbol of the current movement against authoritarianism and the Trump regime. The phoenix is a globally-recognized symbol of renewal and rebirth, and that's really what we're all working towards. The phoenix was part of the first version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Seal_of_the_United_States#Third_committee" target="_blank">Great Seal of the United States</a> (along with many other symbols), so it has a long history here in the United States as well. The Trump regime has done more damage to our nation in the past 6 months than all of our enemies have been able to do, collectively, for 250 years. But we can rise again from these ashes. We can build a better country, one that gets it right this time.</p>
        <p>It's no secret that this country has <b>never</b> lived up to the promises of our <a href="/charters-of-freedom">Charters of Freedom</a>, to build a nation where "all [people] are created equal" and the government should be "of the people, by the people, and for the people." So instead of trying to look back to some imaginary time in the past when the United States of America was "great," we should instead look to the future and try to build such a nation for the first time since our founding.</p>
