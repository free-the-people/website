            <p>The Trump regime's onslaught of stupidity is finally starting to slow as courts are catching up with him. Sending immigrants to Guantanamo, selling off government-owned facilities, mass layoffs of federal workers, and the removal of government watchdogs are all being reversed by the courts because they are illegal.</p>

            </div>
            <p>While this is good news, and a step in the right direction, it's worth noting that these reversals are not permanent, and many people who do not lose their jobs or are re-hired are likely to be fired again once the Trump administration figures out how to do so legally. Don't assume this means Trump has been defeated, or that his attack on America has ended.</p>

            <p>Utah Senator Thatcher <a href="https://www.forwardparty.com/media/press_release/utah_sen_thatcher_leaves_gop_joins_forward/" target="_blank">changes his affiliation</a> from the Republican Party to the Forward Party&mdash;the first sitting state senator representing the Forward party.</p>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.forwardparty.com/" target="_blank">Forward party</a> was formed in 2022. Unlike the Republican or Democratic parties, which only accept right- or left-aligned members, respectively, the Forward party welcomes members with diverse views representing a wide swath of the political spectrum. Instead of dictating policy positions based on their appeal to extreme conservative or liberal ideologies, Forward promotes policies that bring power back to the voters.</p>
            <p>Many Americans choose the candidiates they vote for not on their own merit, but because they don't want the "other" party to win. Out of more than 500,000 elected positions in the United States, 70% of them go uncontested because the candidates are in a decidedly red or blue district and they know the voters won't vote for the "other" party. So they only have to appeal to the most extreme members of their own party who vote in the primary elections to seal their victory in the general election.</p>
            <p>The Forward party seeks to change that, forcing representatives to represent the majority of their constituents, regardless of political affiliation or ideology. They seek to accomplish this by advocating for voter-empowering policies like independent redistricting committees, nonpartisan primaries, and ranked-choice voting.</p>

            <p>The trade war Donald Trump has started with our neighbors, our (former) friends, and our (former) allies is actually illegal. Congress, not the president, has the power to enact tariffs. The president is only allowed to alter tariffs for national security reasons. And there is absolutely no national security risk from Canada or Mexico that justifies this attack on our largest economic partners in the world.</p>
            <p>Trump's claim that these tariffs are in response to fentanyl "pouring into" our country through these borders is a desparate attempt to legitimize his xenophobia. In the case of Canada, his claims are nothing more than a lie, since we only have evidence of a few dozen kilos of fentanyl coming across that <i>enormous</i> border. As for Mexico, fentanyl is admittedly a problem, but not one that justifies or can be solved by antagonizing the Mexican people and hurting American consumers.</p>

           <p>Donald Trump has previously announced plans to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAkiKP_QrB8" target="_blank">force-relocate</a> homeless people to tent-cities on "inexpensive lands" where there would be doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, and drug rehab specialists available to the residents. To date, he has not established any such facilities.</p>
           <p>This week, he threatened to take over D.C. from Mayor Muriel Bowser if she didn't "<a href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-says-dc-must-clear-unsightly-homeless-encampments/3860501/" target="_blank">clean up the unsightly homeless encampments</a>." People are being forced to leave their encampments, but are not being offered access to any alternative facilities or treatments, and will undoubtedly establish a new encampment in a nearby location because evacuating people from a place does not make them cease to exist, nor does it make them any less homeless.</p> 
           <p>In Finland, those experiencing homelessness are treated very differently. Homeless people receive a small apartment to live in, along with support services, with no conditions attached. The <a href="https://thebetter.news/interview-juha-kahila-housing-first-finnland/" target="_blank">Housing First</a> initiative provides people who lose their home with respectable accomodations right away, as well as job opportunities if they need them.</p>
           <p>And here's the real kicker: providing the homeless with housing, support services, and job opportunities actually <i>saves taxpayers money.</i> That's not only true in Finland, but all around the world: "It is always cheaper to house people with support than to leave them in emergency shelters or on the streets."</p>

            On Tuesday, March 4th, my partner and I participated in our first-ever protest at our state's capital. We joined hundreds of like-minded citizens to protest the despicable acts of the current oligarchy.
            <p>
            <p>
                I have to say I was quite surprised by how peaceful and friendly my fellow protestors were. We are all infuriated by the way this regime has been attacking our democracy and our decency as a nation. Yet we were able to meet together in solidarity to raise our voice against tyranny and march together peacefully to make our voices heard.
            </p>
            <p>This was also the first time our <a href="/articles/disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america/">disgraced flag</a> was flown publicly. A lot of people asked about it, and I was more than happy to explain the symbolism, but I now realize I should have brought flyers with me to hand out because sometimes it was hard to hear one another in the crowd.</p>
            <p>Do you want to join the next protest? A great resource for information about events in cities near you is <a href="https://linktr.ee/fiftyfiftyonemovement" target="_blank">fiftyfifty.one</a>. It's time to get <b>loud</b> to save our nation before it's too late.</p>

                <p>Republicans are talking about privatizing the Post Office, among other things. Sounds harmless enough...after all, why use the taxpayer's money to pay for something that could make money for itself?</p>
                <p>Many of the nation's greatest achievements have come from public works paid for by taxpayer's money. Do you like free roads, free parking, and free public libraries? How about subsidies for in-state college tuition and guaranteed mail delivery even in the most rural parts of the United States? These things were made possible by massive public investments in our nation, not by greedy corporations whose only goal is to generate money for their shareholders.</p>
