<p>Recap of this week in the revolution: The United States joins the Axis of Evil and Trump and Vance disgrace the nation on the world stage, destroying our relationship with our former allies around the world. Gaza gives Trump the finger for releasing a video where he takes over Gaza and is idolized for it. GOP representatives allow their constituents to be bullied and brutalized in front of them, while members of Congress declare that federal employees do not deserve their jobs or their paychecks. Join the resistance by calling your representatives and telling them to vote no on the SAVE act, join the March 4th for Democracy protests, or any of the numerous protests happening every day all across the country, and take courses in civil resistance or protecting voting rights.</p>

      <p>In another "Friday Night Massacre" on February 21, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hegseth-defends-jag-firings-unpersuasive-way-possible-rcna193423" target="_blank">fired</a> the country's highest-ranking military officer, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman CQ Brown Jr. He also fired Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti and Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General James Slife.</p>
      <p>But he didn't stop there. His administration also announced that they're firing top military Judge Advocates General (JAG).</p>
      <p>Why fire these exemplary defenders of our once-great nation? Obviously it's to make room to replace them with more bootlickers willing to support a tyrant and unwilling to defend the Constitution.</p>
      <p>Our armed forces are weaker, and our democracy is less protected without these and other watchdogs in the federal government who are there specifically to prevent a power-grab like the one we are currently seeing.</p>

        <p>In an appaling display of brutality, three men dragged Teresa Borrenpohl out of a town hall meeting in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. The men were repeatedly asked to identify themselves and give some indication of their authority to drag Teresa out of her seat, but refused to do so.</p>
        <p>Town hall attendees were angry with the representatives on stage, and several attendees were shouting out questions or criticisms when they were scolded by a disrespectful and arrogant moderator for "popping off with stupid remarks." The moderator continued delivering a slew of insults aimed at the attendees, who collectively booed the moderator, but were unable to silence him. Enraged at the lack of respect these so-called representatives showed their constituents, Teresa asked, "Is this a town hall, or a lecture?" While the other attendees cheered Teresa's response, a local sheriff told Teresa to leave or be arrested. Meanwhile, the moderator continued delivering a non-stop deluge of insults at Teresa and the crowd in an attempt to distract the crowd's attention away from the injustice being carried out, including stating that Teresa was, a "little girl," and "afraid to leave." He even goes so far as to say, "She spoke up, and now she doesn't want to suffer the consequences." He failed to explain why anyone should face consequences for speaking up in a town hall.</p>
        <p>When the sheriff was unable to talk Teresa into leaving the meeting, he called over three unidentified men wearing unmarked street clothes and then cowardly took out his cell phone, retreated to a safe distance, and started recording a video as these unidentified men grabbed Teresa and dragged her forcefully out of her chair. Teresa asked them repeatedly, "who are you?" They never answered the question. Teresa then turned to the sheriff and told him that she was being assaulted. Instead of coming to her aid, identifying these men, or providing any justification or official authorization for their actions, he simple continued recording, grunting, "you out now," while cowering safely away from the assault taking place in front of him. She asked the sheriff if these men were his deputies, and he refused to respond or offer any indication of their identity or affiliation.</p>

        Feb. 28 Economic Blackout
      </a>
    </td>
    <td width="100%">
      <p>On Friday, February 28, I joined my family and fellow patriots around the country in a one-day boycott of large corporations. I did not buy anything or visit any online or brick-and-mortar stores that day.</p>
      <p>The impact of this boycott was probably largely unnoticed by the targeted corporations. I'm sure it made a small dent in their average daily sales, but probably did nothing to actually affect their bottom lines.</p>
      <p>But the point of this boycott was not to hurt corporate America. Instead, the point was to rally people to see if we could get a significant portion of the population to participate in an event like this. If it is possible to get enough people engaged, we might be able to enact some longer-term, more targeted boycotts that might actually have some level of impact.</p>
      <p>For example, continuing or doubling-down on the current boycott of Target stores might pressure them into reinstating the DEI hiring policies they <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/business/target-dei-boycott/index.html" target="_blank">rolled back</a> out of fear that Donald Trump might "investigate" them. After George Floyd was murdered by police in 2020, Target became a leader in promoting DEI practices and gained a reputation as being a progressive employer. But they were also among the first companies to do an about-face in their policies as soon as Trump was elected.</p>

        <p>On Wednesday, February 26, I published the first opinion piece on this website, titled, "<a href="/articles/fort-knox/" target="_blank">Trump and  Musk to Visit Fort Knox</a>."</p>
        <p>On February 20, Donald Trump revealed that he is planning a visit to Fort Knox to see "if the gold is still there." With all of the horrible things that have happened over the past week, this is probably the least significant story, and it was quickly (and appropriately) drowned out in the torrent of disgrace pouring out of the White House every day.</p>
        <p>But something struck me about this statement, so I felt compelled to write this short article to document my suspicion that Trump made this statement to try to distract the press, but may have inadvertently revealed his upcoming plans to claim that someone (Probably Joe Biden or "the Democrats" in general) has stolen America's gold. I believe he will make this claim in an attempt to take the gold himself, or share it with Musk and/or Putin.</p>
        <p>It's a wild claim on my part, and probably (hopefully) is completely unjustified. But I wanted to write it down just in case it actually happens sometime soon.</p>

        <p>House Republicans are pushing a bill, called the SAVE Act that intends to disenfranchise millions of eligible American voters.</p>
        <p>Under the guise of election security, the SAVE Act would require proof of citizenship to be presented to register to vote. When that's all you hear, it sounds very reasonable. But there are problems with this:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Not everyone can access these documents (They are frequently lost or destroyed)</li>
          <li>They must be presented in person, eliminating online and mail-in voter registration</li>
          <li>It would prevent most married women from being able to register to vote if they changed their names when they married</li>
          <li>It makes it easier to intimidate and add barriers to naturalized citizens</li>
          <li>It just makes it harder in general, so fewer people will register to vote</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Indivisible has an <a href="https://indivisible.org/resource/call-now-tell-your-representative-vote-no-save-act" target="_blank">online form</a> you can fill out to get connected directly to your representative so you can tell them to vote NO on this dangerous bill.</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, March 4th, people will gather at their state capitals or nearest cities to join the fight to uphold the Constitution and end executive overreach.</p>
        <p>There are many protests happening every day all across the nation. But we're pushing the "March forth"/"March fourth" protest because it is a generalized protest instead of a targeted protest (There have been protests at Tesla factories targeting Elon Musk and DOGE, protests at ICE agencies protesting immigration intimidation and racism, protests targeting women's rights, LGBTQ+ rights, Black Lives Matter, support for Ukraine, opposition to the genocide in Gaza, etc.).</p>
