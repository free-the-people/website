&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: The United States joins the Axis of Evil and Trump and Vance disgrace the nation on the world stage, destroying our relationship with our former allies around the world. Gaza gives Trump the finger for releasing a video where he takes over Gaza and is idolized for it. GOP representatives allow their constituents to be bullied and brutalized in front of them, while members of Congress declare that federal employees do not deserve their jobs or their paychecks. Join the resistance by calling your representatives and telling them to vote no on the SAVE act, join the March 4th for Democracy protests, or any of the numerous protests happening every day all across the country, and take courses in civil resistance or protecting voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-transparent table-shadow&quot;&gt;

        &lt;img class=&quot;img-link&quot; alt=&quot;Image of a Palestinian solder in combat gear accepting a rose being handed to him by a young boy amidst a pile of rubble on a Gazan street.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;/images/kXK279zCWD-200.webp&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;196&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&quot;Gaza is ours, forever strong. A land of hope, where we belong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In response to the disgusting, narcissistic, and anti-Palestinian &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/7262241/trump-gaza-ai-video-truth-social-resorts-netanyahu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AI video&lt;/a&gt; released on Donald Trump&#39;s Truth Social account, young people of Gaza have created their own AI-generated response video.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://countercurrents.org/2025/02/gaza-youth-release-powerful-counter-video-to-trumps-racist-ai-propaganda/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the response&lt;/a&gt;, we see a bright future ahead for the people of Gaza, but one that they build for themselves where they are definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; worshipping a giant golden statue of Donald Trump (minus all the fat rolls).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;

      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because Congress does not allow remote voting, Colorado District 7 Representative Brittany Pettersen flew to D.C. with her 4-week-old son so she could stand with fellow Democrats and vote no on the budget proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the video on the left, released on Feb 24, 2025, Donald Trump says this of the USMCA trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, among other trade deals:&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I look at some of these agreements, I read them at night, and I&#39;d say, who would ever sign something like this?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;&gt;In the video on the right, released October 6, 2018, Donald Trump says of the USMCA trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico: &quot;It&#39;s my great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So I guess we can safely answer your question...YOU would sign something like this.&lt;/p&gt;        
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

Their reason for resigning?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans&#39; sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services.

        &lt;p&gt;The federal Department of Education is threatening to take funding away from schools that teach diversity intiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Illinois public schools &lt;a href=&quot;https://wgntv.com/news/illinois/illinois-schools-lgbtq-history-state-superintendent/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;refuse to be bullied&lt;/a&gt;, and have announced that they will continue teaching students about the contributions of the LGBTQ+ community, citing the state&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Inclusive Curriculum Implementation Guidance:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To create an equitable society that is inclusive and affirming for people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, it is necessary to teach young people the roles and contributions of the LGBTQ+ community.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div style=&quot;display:flex;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div style=&quot;min-width:400px;&quot;&gt;

        &lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 5px;flex-shrink:1&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Alsup tells the Office of Personnel Management to rescind its directives to fire probationary employees in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Park Service, the Small Business Administration, the Bureau of Land Management, the Department of Defense, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;OPM does not have authority to fire employees from other agencies. Defense attorney&#39;s argued that OPM was merely asking the other agencies to terminate employees, but Judge Alsup felt that the speed at which the terminations took place made it all too apparent that this was an order.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Bad&lt;/h4&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In another &quot;Friday Night Massacre&quot; on February 21, Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hegseth-defends-jag-firings-unpersuasive-way-possible-rcna193423&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the country&#39;s highest-ranking military officer, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman CQ Brown Jr. He also fired Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti and Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General James Slife.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But he didn&#39;t stop there. His administration also announced that they&#39;re firing top military Judge Advocates General (JAG).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why fire these exemplary defenders of our once-great nation? Obviously it&#39;s to make room to replace them with more bootlickers willing to support a tyrant and unwilling to defend the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our armed forces are weaker, and our democracy is less protected without these and other watchdogs in the federal government who are there specifically to prevent a power-grab like the one we are currently seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On February 24, 2025, the United States officially &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/24/politics/us-joins-russia-ukraine-un-vote&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;joined the Axis of Evil&lt;/a&gt; when it sided with Russia, North Korea, and Belarus to vote &lt;b&gt;against&lt;/b&gt; a resolution condemning Russia for the Ukraine war.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has completely sold our country to Vladimir Putin. And the worst part is, we don&#39;t seem to even get anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Combined with the disastrous debacle in the Oval Office on Friday, February 28 (See &lt;i&gt;The Ugly&lt;/i&gt; section below), it is clear that Donald Trump is nothing more than Putin&#39;s puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;200px&quot; class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On February 14, the White House barred access to all A.P. journalists for no reason other than their refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico by the incorrect and idiotic name, &lt;i&gt;Gulf of America&lt;/i&gt;. On February 25, the White House &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-journalists-access-to-trump/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went even further&lt;/a&gt;, announcing that it was going to pick and choose which media outlets were given the opportunity to cover the president in close quarters. The selection of journalists allowed into these spaces has traditionally been performed by the White House Correspondents Association.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that this decision was made right after barring the Associated Press, the White House claims that this affront to the freedom of the press was enacted to give more and new outlets a chance to take part in the press pool.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just how dumb do they think the American people are?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-transparent table-shadow&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The most disgraceful display in the history of the United States took place on Friday, February 28, 2025. Another &lt;b&gt;date which will live in infamy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The entire world was shocked when Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum in the Oval Office because Volodymyr Zelenskyy wasn&#39;t being nice enough to &lt;b&gt;Vladimir Putin!&lt;/b&gt; Trump seemed surprised that Zelenskyy didn&#39;t seem to like the president of the nation that invaded his land and killed his people.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;
        &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZThLlfMvMRY?si=0irdFWA1ENoA8uFw&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The United States is now an enemy of freedom, justice, and democracy. We have been forever shamed by this abhorrent display of weakness, cowardice, and disrespect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In an appaling display of brutality, three men dragged Teresa Borrenpohl out of a town hall meeting in Coeur d&#39;Alene, Idaho. The men were repeatedly asked to identify themselves and give some indication of their authority to drag Teresa out of her seat, but refused to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Town hall attendees were angry with the representatives on stage, and several attendees were shouting out questions or criticisms when they were scolded by a disrespectful and arrogant moderator for &quot;popping off with stupid remarks.&quot; The moderator continued delivering a slew of insults aimed at the attendees, who collectively booed the moderator, but were unable to silence him. Enraged at the lack of respect these so-called representatives showed their constituents, Teresa asked, &quot;Is this a town hall, or a lecture?&quot; While the other attendees cheered Teresa&#39;s response, a local sheriff told Teresa to leave or be arrested. Meanwhile, the moderator continued delivering a non-stop deluge of insults at Teresa and the crowd in an attempt to distract the crowd&#39;s attention away from the injustice being carried out, including stating that Teresa was, a &quot;little girl,&quot; and &quot;afraid to leave.&quot; He even goes so far as to say, &quot;She spoke up, and now she doesn&#39;t want to suffer the consequences.&quot; He failed to explain why anyone should face consequences for speaking up in a town hall.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the sheriff was unable to talk Teresa into leaving the meeting, he called over three unidentified men wearing unmarked street clothes and then cowardly took out his cell phone, retreated to a safe distance, and started recording a video as these unidentified men grabbed Teresa and dragged her forcefully out of her chair. Teresa asked them repeatedly, &quot;who are you?&quot; They never answered the question. Teresa then turned to the sheriff and told him that she was being assaulted. Instead of coming to her aid, identifying these men, or providing any justification or official authorization for their actions, he simple continued recording, grunting, &quot;you out now,&quot; while cowering safely away from the assault taking place in front of him. She asked the sheriff if these men were his deputies, and he refused to respond or offer any indication of their identity or affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a shocking display of people in positions of power treating the citizens they are supposed to be serving with utter contempt. Or, should I say, people in positions of power sending in their goons to mistreat the citizens they are supposed to be serving while they sit idly by in safety, pretending they are not responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has this to say to federal workers in the United States:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Those are not real jobs producing federal revenue. By the way, they are consuming taxpayer dollars. Those jobs are paid for by the American tax people who work real jobs, earn real income, pay federal taxes, and then pay these federal employees. Federal employees do not deserve their jobs. Federal employees do not deserve their paychecks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You should be ashamed of yourself Marjorie. We are certainly ashamed of you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;

        Feb. 28 Economic Blackout
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On Friday, February 28, I joined my family and fellow patriots around the country in a one-day boycott of large corporations. I did not buy anything or visit any online or brick-and-mortar stores that day.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The impact of this boycott was probably largely unnoticed by the targeted corporations. I&#39;m sure it made a small dent in their average daily sales, but probably did nothing to actually affect their bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But the point of this boycott was not to hurt corporate America. Instead, the point was to rally people to see if we could get a significant portion of the population to participate in an event like this. If it is possible to get enough people engaged, we might be able to enact some longer-term, more targeted boycotts that might actually have some level of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, continuing or doubling-down on the current boycott of Target stores might pressure them into reinstating the DEI hiring policies they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/business/target-dei-boycott/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rolled back&lt;/a&gt; out of fear that Donald Trump might &quot;investigate&quot; them. After George Floyd was murdered by police in 2020, Target became a leader in promoting DEI practices and gained a reputation as being a progressive employer. But they were also among the first companies to do an about-face in their policies as soon as Trump was elected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;/td&gt; 
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, February 26, I published the first opinion piece on this website, titled, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/articles/fort-knox/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trump and  Musk to Visit Fort Knox&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On February 20, Donald Trump revealed that he is planning a visit to Fort Knox to see &quot;if the gold is still there.&quot; With all of the horrible things that have happened over the past week, this is probably the least significant story, and it was quickly (and appropriately) drowned out in the torrent of disgrace pouring out of the White House every day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But something struck me about this statement, so I felt compelled to write this short article to document my suspicion that Trump made this statement to try to distract the press, but may have inadvertently revealed his upcoming plans to claim that someone (Probably Joe Biden or &quot;the Democrats&quot; in general) has stolen America&#39;s gold. I believe he will make this claim in an attempt to take the gold himself, or share it with Musk and/or Putin.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a wild claim on my part, and probably (hopefully) is completely unjustified. But I wanted to write it down just in case it actually happens sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

          Civil Resistance Course
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This week, I signed up for the self-paced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usip.org/academy/catalog/civil-resistance-1-dynamics-nonviolent-movements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Civil Resistance 1: The Dynamics of Nonviolent Movements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; course from the United States Institute of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure how long this course will be available before Musk&#39;s rats devour the USIP along with every other government agency targeted for reduction or elimination by Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But for now, I am looking forward to participating in the course. I have only completed the introduction so far, and have not yet started the true course content, which I will be participating in in the week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What can you do in the week ahead?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-transparent table-shadow&quot;&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;House Republicans are pushing a bill, called the SAVE Act that intends to disenfranchise millions of eligible American voters.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under the guise of election security, the SAVE Act would require proof of citizenship to be presented to register to vote. When that&#39;s all you hear, it sounds very reasonable. But there are problems with this:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Not everyone can access these documents (They are frequently lost or destroyed)&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;They must be presented in person, eliminating online and mail-in voter registration&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;It would prevent most married women from being able to register to vote if they changed their names when they married&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;It makes it easier to intimidate and add barriers to naturalized citizens&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;It just makes it harder in general, so fewer people will register to vote&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Indivisible has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://indivisible.org/resource/call-now-tell-your-representative-vote-no-save-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online form&lt;/a&gt; you can fill out to get connected directly to your representative so you can tell them to vote NO on this dangerous bill.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, March 4th, people will gather at their state capitals or nearest cities to join the fight to uphold the Constitution and end executive overreach.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are many protests happening every day all across the nation. But we&#39;re pushing the &quot;March forth&quot;/&quot;March fourth&quot; protest because it is a generalized protest instead of a targeted protest (There have been protests at Tesla factories targeting Elon Musk and DOGE, protests at ICE agencies protesting immigration intimidation and racism, protests targeting women&#39;s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, Black Lives Matter, support for Ukraine, opposition to the genocide in Gaza, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to sign up for a protest in a city near you, you can find valuable resources along with a list of local events on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiftyfifty.one&quot;&gt;50501 website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>Recap of this week in the revolution. Trump does more damage in 30 days in office than any other enemy in history, the resistance finds a new anthem in Hostile Government Takeover by A Gift from Todd, more Republicans openly display the Nazi salute to cheering crowds, Trump supporters start to realize that Trump&#39;s policies are as damaging to them as they are to the rest of the country, and Free the People launches a new merch store to sell the disgraced flag of the United States. Join the fight by participating in the February 28 blackout, taking a Minute of US at 12:53 pm every Wednesday, or joining an Indivisible.org Zoom call to find out &quot;What&#39;s the plan?&quot;</summary>

            <![CDATA[
            
&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt at at a recap of the past week&#39;s events, and I just thought of it yesterday, so it might be a bit awkward or self-serving, and it probably won&#39;t contain that much to interest you. But hopefully over time I can build this concept into a useful or at least entertaining resource for the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly this week&lt;/h4&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has now been in his second presidential term for more than 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In just one month, this man has done more damage to the United States of America than all of our enemies, combined, have been able to do over the course of the last 250 years.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Author Ryan Cooper compares the current collapse of the United States to the collapse of empires in the past. While all empires eventually fall, even the most incompetent leaders in history have never managed to bungle their countries so badly.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hostile Government Takeover&lt;/b&gt; by artist &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@agiftfromtodd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A Gift from Todd&lt;/a&gt; blew up on TikTok this week and has become the unofficial new anthem for the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On the HBO show, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw0F8G4-dMw&amp;t=1411s&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Lask Week Tonight&lt;/a&gt; (February 16, 2025), host John Oliver calls the song the &quot;best encapsulation I&#39;ve seen of this particular moment so far.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The song has been remixed countless times, like the one below:&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;When I see Steve Bannon doing a Nazi salute to cheers it means only one thing:

            420,000 U.S. troops died defending our country from Nazi assholes and 77 million people voted for them to be in power.
            
            MAGA betrayed our country voting for this nightmare.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dd5oeph7qd6x42t6j2kumgvr/post/3lip4rs22bc2i?ref_src=embed&quot;&gt;[image or embed]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; CALL TO ACTIVISM (&lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dd5oeph7qd6x42t6j2kumgvr?ref_src=embed&quot;&gt;@calltoactivism.bsky.social&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href=&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dd5oeph7qd6x42t6j2kumgvr/post/3lip4rs22bc2i?ref_src=embed&quot;&gt;February 21, 2025 at 8:31 AM&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Steve Bannon delivers a Nazi salute after making disturbing remarks at CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference). Instead of being outraged, the crowd cheered him on.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think this was just released this week, but I first heard about it this week...&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapquest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MapQuest&lt;/a&gt; launched a new interactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulfof.mapquest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Name your own gulf&lt;/a&gt; tool to allow &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; to re-name the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, February 18, Donald Trump announced that the Associated Press would no longer be allowed to attend his news conferences because they refuse to call the Gulf of Mexico by the stupid name he came up with for it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yeah, right, Donny. I&#39;m sure &lt;b&gt;that&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; why you don&#39;t want the Associated Press around.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The harder Trump fights against people who don&#39;t kneel to his misguided sense of self-worth, the more people can see through his stupidity to the scared little boy that he is.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Trump supporters are starting to catch on to the fact that Trump and Musk&#39;s viscous attacks on our civil servants are hurting &lt;i&gt;everyone,&lt;/i&gt; not just those who refuse to hail (sieg heil?) king Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Republican leaders around the nation are begging Trump to leave &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; programs and people alone, hoping that they will survive the downfall of the country and only the &quot;others&quot; will have to feel the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What did &quot;we&quot; do this week?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-transparent table-shadow&quot;&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today was the first time I tried flying the &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america/&quot;&gt;Disgraced Flag of the United States of America&lt;/a&gt;. This flag is &lt;b&gt;Free the People&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; symbol of protest against the current oligarchy, and one we&#39;re sharing with others who may be interested.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I bought the prototype flag from our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethepeople.printify.me/product/18125125/the-disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america&quot; target=&quot;store&quot;&gt;Printify&lt;/a&gt; merch store. The flag came out very well, and is of high quality. In fact, the material is so thick and heavy, I was afraid it wouldn&#39;t fly, but it did a nice job with the breeze that was blowing. I think I&#39;ll look around for another provider who might be able to print a flag on even lighter material to ensure it will fly in even the lightest breeze, but this works well enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The total cost (including tax and shipping) was $31.54. If you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethepeople.printify.me/product/18125125/the-disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america&quot; target=&quot;store&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and select the 36&quot; x 60&quot; option, you should be able to get it at a similar price (Though your taxes and shipping will be slightly different from mine). I do not receive any money for flags ordered from that link...you just pay the cost to print it and ship it directly to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It took 11 days from the time I ordered the flag until I received it, and for most of that time the tracking number showed that the label was printed, but the package had not been received by the post office. That tells me that it was made in China and shipped overseas before hitting the post office, even though the provider was listed as being in the United States. I have no objection to ordering products from China, but thought I&#39;d mention it on case you do.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;

      &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This week, I also opened &lt;b&gt;Free the People&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethepeople.printify.me/&quot; target=&quot;store&quot;&gt;merch store&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://printify.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Printify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We wanted a store primarily to sell the &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america&quot;&gt;Disgraced Flag of the United States of America&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who might want a copy. But while I was setting it up, I did make a couple other products for us to sell just for fun. We will probably add additional merchandise over time as we think of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Everything in the store comes in two variants: One is sold at-cost (I/we receive absolutely no money from your order), and the other has a markup (25-35%) that is paid to me, Doug Lockwood, directly. This gives people the option to provide a small donation if they like what we have to offer, but is by no means obligatory. If I do receive any donations, I will either spend them on resources to improve this website, the tools we will offer to fellow resistance fighters, or re-donate them to the organizations that are fighting against the current oligarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The pin is just the &lt;b&gt;Free the People&lt;/b&gt; logo. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d want to wear our logo around, but hey, whatever floats your boat!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I do particularly like the notebook. On the cover, it has the disgraced flag and says...&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:0.5rem;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;This is my plan to...&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Defy and undermine the oligarchy&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Engage with my elected officials&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Fight for equal rights for ALL&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Elect leaders who uphold democracy&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Neutralize hate speech with empathy&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Demand accountability from leaders&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That spells out &quot;DEFEND,&quot; so I call this my &quot;D.E.F.E.N.D. Democracy&quot; notebook. On the back it displays the proper American flag and says...&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:0.5rem&quot;&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;And that&#39;s how I helped restore freedom and justice to the United States of America.&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The hat has the disgraced flag on it with our &lt;a href=&quot;/about/vision&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; statement overlaid in fancy script: &quot;Free the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This wasn&#39;t really released &lt;i&gt;this week,&lt;/i&gt; but I wanted to point out that we do make some of our digital resources, such as the disgraced flag images, available to anyone who might want to use them. The selection is sparse right now, but we do hope to add more assets over time as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can find our assets in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/free-the-people/assets&quot; target=&quot;github&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. These assets were previously licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International license, but this week, we removed the license restrictions. Our intention all along was to make these images available to the public to use how they like, so the license was not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What can &quot;you&quot; do over the next week?&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;February 28, 2025:&lt;/b&gt; For one full day, avoid spending any money whatsoever at any major retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t going to end the totalitarian regime we are under by any means. But if corporations start to feel their profits may decrease because the people are angry, they will turn against those in power. Since big corporations have more voice in the current government than the people do, it may be that the only way we can make our voices heard is by making &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; speak for &lt;i&gt;us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;b&gt;&quot;We refuse to tune out and instead bear witness in reflection, meditation, and prayer on the harms being done — so we can stay in motion together.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why 12:53 pm? That&#39;s the time when the January 6 protestors crossed the police baricades in 2021. It&#39;s also the time that the three richest men in the world were sitting at Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Each week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://indivisible.org/indivisible-trainings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Indivisible.org&lt;/a&gt; hosts a massive Zoom call to try to make some sense of the chaos we are all in and bring people together to process it all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This as a massive, nationwide call, so it&#39;s not targeted to specific events or activities in your area, but the hosts do try to answer questions submitted in advance or during the call. They can&#39;t get to all of them, but they do a good job of cutting through the noise and encouraging real actions you can take.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
