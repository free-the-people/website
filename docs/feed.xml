&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: Crawford wins Wisconsin despite election interference, Sen. Booker makes history with 25-hour speech, and bipartisan bill brings House to a standstill. Trump tries to make voting harder for millions, and DOE turns over it&amp;#39;s responsibility along with a billion-dollar contract to a highly questionable company. Judge orders a man deported by mistake to be brought back to the U.S. while DOGE tries to take over the federal payroll system. Protesters around the nation gather to tell Trump: Hands Off! Join the resistance by supporting Ukraine, support those who are targeted by the Trump regime, and ditch big tech apps for ethical alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the United States are here under Temporary Protected Status (TPS) while their home country is undergoing a crisis, war, or disaster. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem decided that those protections should not be honored. In a 78-page decision, U.S. District Judge Edward Chen pointed out that Noem&#39;s decision was a &quot;classic example of racism.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;&quot;The Secretary&#39;s rationale is entirely lacking in evidentiary support,&quot; Chen wrote. &quot;Venezuelan TPS holders have lower rates of criminality than the general population.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk sank $25 million into a state supreme court election to support Republican Brad Schimel, including bribing voters by offering to pay them up to $1 million to sign a declaration that they agreed with Trump&#39;s political agenda. Despite the unprecedented investment/bribery in a state Supreme Court election, voters elected Susan Crawford.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;While her win is good news, I want to caution anyone from seeing a 55%-45% election win as a crushing blow to the Trump regime. It is a clear, incontestable win, but it remains disturbingly close. If 45% of any electorate is &lt;i&gt;still&lt;/i&gt; willing to support Trump-like policies and politicians, we have a long fight ahead of us.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in Florida, Republicans held on to two recently-vacated seats in deep red districts, bringing the Republican House majority to 220-213. But they won by narrower margins than previously expected, indicating support for Trump Republicans is waning even where they continue to win.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;This speech was not a filibuster, which is a form of obstruction in the legislature where someone prolongs the debate on proposed legislation to delay or prevent a decision from being made. There was no legislation being obstructed by the speech. Instead, this was an act of defiance of the Trump regime and a means of opposing the Republican majority in the Senate.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Andrew Rabinowitz was once a lawyer helping big property management companies, including one owned by Jared Kushner, evict tenants from their low-income apartments in New Jersey. Now, he has turned his back on that life and is representing tenants against their big landlords.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In his previous work, Rabinowitz represented the landlords against the tenants they were evicting. He did what he could to try to come to an equitable agreement between both parties, and was once called, &quot;the fairest debt collector in town.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But things changed for Rabinowitz when Maryland passed a law giving &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; tenant the right to an attorney, and providing funding for them. Now he works for &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.risingforjustice.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rising for Justice&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/i&gt; a nonprofit organization offering free legal representation to low-income tenants being evicted. He took the job for a significantly lower salary than he had before, but he sleeps better at night now that he&#39;s making a difference in the lives of his clients instead of just &quot;putting money into rich people&#39;s pockets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Representative Brittany Pettersen, a Colorado Democrat, and Representative Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican, have been trying to pass legislation to allow new parents to designate someone to vote for them by proxy for 12 weeks after the birth of a child. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who opposes the bill, used his authority to refuse putting the bill up for a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But the bill received enough support to bypass Johnson&#39;s authority, so he tried to invoke new rules to prevent the bill from being passed. This prompted Luna to bring forward her petition as &quot;privileged,&quot; forcing it to be voted on. In response, Johnson canceled all scheduled votes for the rest of the week.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Nick LaLota, a New York Republican, indicated he would vote no on the bill, but said, &quot;Members who oppose her proposal should negotiate with her to amend it or persuade 218 members to vote &#39;no,&#39; rather than deny her a vote on the merits.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The IMLS provides funding to libraries and museums in the form of grants. These funds make up the majority of all federal library funds. Say goodbye to any new federal funding for libraries, and without a staff to administer the already-approved grants, they will most likely be terminated.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;But to add insult to injury, DOGE has transferred ownership of the headquarters of the dismantled USIP to the General Services Administration without paying for it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin:1rem&quot;&gt;&quot;To state this plainly: DOGE forced out the directors and staff of a nonexecutive agency and installed one of its own GSA staffers as president, and that person is now attempting to hand the institute’s $500 million headquarters over to the agency he came from, at zero cost.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The Musk rats at DOGE have been working to cripple the administration, and this outage is a sign that it is working. As the system falters, DOGE will say, &quot;See, the SSA is not doing a good job,&quot; and will claim that continuing to fund the program is wasteful, since it can&#39;t carry out its mission. They will use this to justify further and deeper cuts until the entire system collapses.
            &lt;p&gt;Why? Workers who have no hope for their future and no opportunity to retire are much easier to exploit than those who have financial security.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s new executive order would require voters to show documentation of citizenship before registering for elections, set limits on counting mail-in ballots, set rules for voting equipment, and prohibit non-U.S. citizens from being able to donate.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On the surface, these rules seem to be acceptable, or even reasonable. But what&#39;s behind them? The supposed issues these changes seek to &quot;fix&quot; are already rare and/or punishable by law. The prevention of foreign contributions is mainly targeted at a single investor who lives in the U.S. and has donated heavily to support liberal causes.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Constitution is quite clear that it is up to the states to determine the &quot;times, places, and manner&quot; for running elections, although Congress can set regulations on elections. The president, however, has no such authority. In 2021, when Biden issued an executive order to promote voting access, Republicans claimed the order was unconstitutional. If they were right, Trump&#39;s executive order is just as unconstitutional.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s economic and foreign polices are all based on the belief that the United States is the most important nation in the world, and that the rest of the world has no choice but to do whatever we tell them.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But this belief, like all of Trump&#39;s beliefs, is not only wrong, it&#39;s foolish. As the United States rattles its saber with tariffs and threats of takeover, the rest of the world is working hard and fast to establish new trade partnerships that exclude the United States. China and the European Union are both well-positioned to fill the void left by the United States. Southeast Asia, South America, and Africa are poised for rapid growth as the world&#39;s major providers of goods. The importance of the U.S. Dollar in world trade is rapidly declining.&lt;/p&gt;

          Venezuelan immigrant sent to El Salvador prison by mistake, and U.S. refuses to bring him back &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oir7zv2NdcE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Venezuelans living in the United States were rounded up and sold to an El Salvador slave prison without due process. The Trump regime later admitted that at least one of these was picked up and shipped out due to a &quot;clerical error.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When caught doing something terrible, members of the Trump regime will all just lie like a dog and pretend what they did was actually a good thing. Now the Trump regime is claiming that the man, Kilmor Armando Abrego Garcia, is a member of a &lt;i&gt;different&lt;/i&gt; gang. When asked for evidence to back that up, White House Press Secretary Levitt says, &quot;I saw it this morning,&quot; as if anyone cares whether &lt;i&gt;she&#39;s&lt;/i&gt; seen it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To make matters even worse, Abrego Garcia was not only here in the country legally, but a judge had issued an order to &lt;i&gt;prevent&lt;/i&gt; him from being deported to his home country of El Salvador because his life would be at risk if he were to return home. So, the Trump regime swept him up with hundreds of &lt;i&gt;Venezuelan&lt;/i&gt; immigrants and sent him to El Salvador...the one place he was not allowed to be sent to.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A judge has ordered the Trump regime to bring Abrego Garcia back within 3 days...we&#39;ll see if they comply.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;DOGE has demanded several of its associates (not all of whom work for DOGE directly) be given full-control of all systems in the Department of Interior, allegedly to create, pause, and delete e-mail accounts (Because, I guess, that&#39;s how you find and stop fraud...by creating new e-mail accounts or pausing or deleting existing e-mail accounts, right?). Having this level of access would allow DOGE to also access payroll systems, access personal data of federal workers, or even stop payments to individual workers.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This level of access is designed to be split among multiple actors to prevent any single person from having this level of access...and more importantly, to minimize the potential damage a breached account might cause. Concerned DOI officials asked for more information about this unprecedented request to weigh the inherent security risks, but the DOGE team refused to provide any such information.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has let his &quot;universal&quot; new tariffs slide when it comes to the energy sector. Why would they be excluded?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It might have something to do with the $96 million big oil poured into Trump&#39;s campaign in exchange for promises to roll back environmental regulations and deregulate the entire sector.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Saturday, April 5, 2025, I joined millions of my fellow Americans to take to the streets in protest of the wanton destruction of our government and our democracy by the Trump regime.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america&quot;&gt;Disgraced Flag of the United States&lt;/a&gt; even made another appearance on the streets in one of the 1,200+ protests, flying in defiance of the Trump regime.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;
            &lt;img class=&quot;img-link&quot; alt=&quot;Hands Off protest, April 5, 2025, with Disgraced Flag of the United States on display&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;/images/EsdQR3YxUJ-200.webp&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;114&quot;&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s nice to see each protest getting larger and drawing larger crowds. No protest is going to fix the problems with our country, but as the protests grow larger and louder, people start to believe in a future where Donald Trump is no longer the president and the nation is represented by a government &lt;b&gt;of the people, by the people, and for the people.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://civilianshield.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Civilian Shield&lt;/a&gt; provides resources and support to civilians and civil servants in war-torn Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Unlike larger non-government organizations (NGOs), Civilian Shield&#39;s smaller size allows it to rapidly position itself where it is needed most, when it is needed the most.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;When the Soviet Union collapsed, Ukraine was left with a large stockpile of nuclear weapons. The world was worried about the proliferation of nuclear-armed nations after the fall of the Soviet Union, and Ukraine agreed to disarm themselves in exchange for a promise from the United States and Russia that they would protect Ukraine&#39;s fledgling democracy from any potential aggressors who might threaten their sovereignty or safety.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Russia broke that promise each time they invaded Ukraine. The United States broke that promise by failing to protect Ukraine from Russia. In the video, we learn that &quot;Christopher&quot; is fulfilling the promise that his country has broken, and asks others to help out in whatever way they can.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;There are many tools the Democrats could use to obstruct or deny Republican actions, but only if they use them skillfully and coordinate with one another.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump threatened to remove security clearances for the firm&#39;s lawyers, and in return they have agreed to provide $40 million worth of free legal services specifically to support the Trump administration&#39;s agenda. Other law firms have similarly bowed the knee.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But not all law firms are feckless cowards. There are some, in fact, there are many, that are standing up against Donald Trump&#39;s assault on the legislative branch and refuse to be intimidated.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s intimidation tactics are clearly unconstitutional, and blatantly obstruct the constitutionally-mandated separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches of the government.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Democratic candidate James Malone wins the 36th Senate District seat in Pennsylvania, representing a mostly rural district that backed Trump by 15% over Harris in 2024. Malone is the first Democrat elected to this district seat since the 1980s, when the district&#39;s boundaries were redrawn.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Malone&#39;s victory does not affect the Republican majority in the State Senate, but it does show a shift in support for Donald Trump in light of the &quot;chaos Washington Republicans have brought to our state,&quot; according to Pennsylvania Senator Vincent Hughes.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The decline in support for Donald Trump is also showing up in other ways. Recently, the Trump regime &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/27/trump-elise-stefanik-united-nations.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;withdrew&lt;/a&gt; it&#39;s nomination of Representative Elise Stefanik for the role of Ambassador to the United Nations because her appointment would trigger a special election in New York, and the Trump administration can&#39;t count on a Republican win.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Paving the way for a visit to Greenland by second lady Usha Vance (and possibly VP JD Vance), U.S. officials have been trying to find someone&amp;mdash;&lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt;&amp;mdash;in Greenland willing to open their homes for a visit. They found no one.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;This can hardly come as a surprise, after the Trump regime has repeatedly threatened to take over Greenland &quot;one way or another.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In case Greenland&#39;s position on the subject wasn&#39;t perfectly clear, one Greenlander designed a custom anti-MAGA hat that says what all Greenlanders are thinking: &quot;Make America Go Away.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;/div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Remarkably, the United States has managed to infuriate yet another country that is otherwise known around the world for their friendly demeanor and welcoming attitudes.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of thousands of immigrants who legally entered the country from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, will see their rights to live in the United States revoked in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is the latest attack the Trump regime has launched against immigrants since taking office.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s worth noting that, in 2024, the Biden administration had the option to extend the program that allowed these migrants to enter the United States legally, but chose not to continue the program and extend the stay of these immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;When Donald Trump was inaugurated he promised that, &quot;never again will the immense power of the state be weaponized to persecute political opponents.&quot; Two months later, his sycophants are saying, &quot;when it comes to protesters, we gotta make sure we treat all of them the same: Send them to jail.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s hardly a surprise that Donald Trump lied to the American people. Again. But no president in the United States has ever been so brutal in weaponizing his power as Trump. And that includes using that power to suppress free speech.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;He has blocked access to the White House by the free press, punished law firms for ruling against him, disregarded court orders, and punished universities for &quot;allowing&quot; students to exercise their rights to free speech. He&#39;s not stopping there, either. Anyone who legally immigrated to this country who &lt;i&gt;dares&lt;/i&gt; to speak out against him or his regime will be arrested and deported. This is just testing the waters. Make no mistake...he&#39;s looking for a way to imprison &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; who criticizes him, natural-born citizen or not.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;That&#39;s about half of all government revenue that is not earmarked for social security, medicare, medicaid, and military spending, and about 10% of the overall budget.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These loses are directly tied to the staffing cuts made by DOGE. Officials predict that this loss of revenue will come from fewer people paying their taxes and fewer resources dedicated to investigations of high-value corporations and individual taxpayers. The administration was warned of this possibility back in January, before any cuts were made, but they proceeded with their aggressive cuts to the IRS anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;That, alone, is gross incompetence that should result in the immediate removal of everyone involved from government service. Permanently. But their stupidity doesn&#39;t end there.

But, hey, they work for Trump, so chances are none of them will be held accountable for risking the lives of our service members and destroying whatever credibility we have left with whatever allies we have left.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Calling this &quot;insane&quot; is true, but really doesn&#39;t even begin to capture the depths of depravity behind a move like this.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of Venezuelans have been deported to an El Salvador torture center by the Trump regime, allegedly because they were members of a violent gang known as Tren de Aragua. But many family members of the deported immigrants have said they were not involved in any gangs.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;ICE agents detaining these men gave no legal reason for the arrest, but admitted they were targeting &quot;everyone who has tattoos.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trump administration denies this, of course, but has yet to provide any ties between the deportees and gang members. This lack of evidence, they claim, &quot;demonstrates that they are terrorists.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apparently, in the new United States of America, doing nothing wrong makes you a terrorist. But maybe that&#39;s only if you have tattoos. Or something. I really can&#39;t understand the twists and turns being used to justify this nightmare we live in.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump announced that he will move the federal student load program to the Small Business Administration. This comes after he announced that he will close the Department of Education, which currently administers the loans.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Just like most of Trump&#39;s proclamations, this one is illegal. But that&#39;s never stopped him before, so it&#39;s unlikely to make a difference now.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This shift will, no doubt, cause profound disruptions to the already-shaky student loan program. A spokesperson for the Debt Collective said, &quot;This dismantling of the Department of Education will not save anyone a dime&amp;mdash;in fact, it will come at great cost to our economy.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez are touring the nation to rally the people to stand up against Trump&#39;s takeover of our government. Despite the fact that this is not an election year, these two representatives are drawing the largest crowds in their history as people pour out to show support for the Democrats who dare to stand up to Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;In Denver, over 34,000 people gathered at their state capital to hear the two speak. Sanders had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p style=&quot;margin-left:2rem;&quot;&gt;
                    &quot;In the hundreds of rallies that I have done, we have never, ever, had a rally as large as this.&quot;
                &lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;The tour was launched in February, and is primarily targeted at working-class districts with mixed constituents (Won by Biden in 2020, but a Republican House Representative in 2024). Reporters point out that half of the RSVPs for Denver&#39;s event came from people who were not on Sanders&#39; supporter list.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;div&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;A recent poll indicates that 72% of Americans are &quot;concerned about tariffs,&quot; up 11% in the past two months. In every category surveyed (Democrats, Republicans, and Independents), more than 80% of respondents said they are concerned about the economy and inflation.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;How does Donald Trump respond to these growing concerns over his policies? The same way he always does: Double-down on the very policies that people are complaining about.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Right now, tariffs can be seen as leverage over other countries, who depend on the income they receive from their goods purchased in the United States. But that leverage only works when it is applied skillfully. Trump&#39;s tariffs will cause foreign suppliers to seek now markets for their goods, decreasing their reliance on American money and weakening the leverage tariffs have over them.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trump has repeatedly promised &quot;not to touch&quot; the Social Security Administration in his dismantling of the country. Why? Not because he cares about it or relies on it. But because everyone knows that cutting social security benefits for American citizens will not be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But what if the social security system just happened to fall apart on its own? Then he could preside over the demise of the most popular government policy in the United States and claim it wasn&#39;t his fault.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;That seems to be the plan, according to a leaked internal memo from the social security administration. Instead of proposing cuts to benefits, Trump and Musk will simply cripple the day-to-day operations of the already-struggling SSA until it is no longer able to function.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under the guise of addressing the national debt, a new push to amend the Constitution could give Trump even more power.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Under Article V the Constitution, if 2/3 of the states request a convention to propose and pass amendments, it must be granted. There has never been a time when 2/3 of the states have called for this, but activist organizations are trying to push the claim that old calls for convention, dating back to the 1700s, count towards the total needed (34 states). If every historical call for a convention is counted, the total may reach 34, but nearly half of the calls for convention that activists are counting have been formally rescinded.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is nothing more than another in a long line of absurd power grabs based on lies and blatant abuses of our legal system. The goal would be to create a forum where changes to the constitution could be drafted and approved quickly in a single convention, rather than being dragged out over many years as the normal process would require.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Musk&#39;s rats forced their way into the United States Institute of Peace to install a new president.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Because the USIP is an independent, nonprofit institute, the Office of Management and Budget is only authorized to comment in the institute&#39;s budget requests. The president of the United States has power to remove USIP board members in certain circumstances, but USIP contends that he has no authority to fire the president of the USIP.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;George Foote, a lawyer representing USIP, said the headquarters was &quot;seized by force, by police officers with guns acting under the authority of a resolution that we are going to get a court to declare invalid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;A federal judge denied an emergency request to restrain DOGE, but expressed concern over DOGE&#39;s aggressive moves and the use of armed police officers in the takeover. &quot;I have to say, I&#39;m offended on behalf of the American citizens who have done so much service to this country to be treated so abominably,&quot; she said.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Republicans are making sweeping tax cuts to benefit the rich. Under the new plan, &quot;America&#39;s top 0.1% would get a tax cut of $278,000 while 28 million households in the bottom 80 percent would have no change in their tax bill and 14 million in the bottom [20] percent would actually have their taxes go up.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These tax cuts are estimated to increase the budget deficit by about $3 trillion dollars over the next decade, all while transferring wealth from the poorest in the country to the richest.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We call anyone who favors policies like this a &quot;Dooh Nibor,&quot; because they are taking money from the poor to give to the rich. Dooh Nibor is Robin Hood spelled backwards, which fits since these people are doing the opposite of Robin Hood, who famously stole from the rich to give to the poor.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Trump regime deported 250 people claiming they are members of a Venezuelan prison gang known as Tren de Aragua. But no one knows if that&#39;s true or not, because the deported individuals did not receive a trial.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;These deportations happened despite the fact that a federal judge had ordered the regime to stop deportations and to turn around any planes already in the air. The Trump regime claimed that they did not have to comply because the planes were outside U.S. territory when the order came in.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The removal was carried out under the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime provision allowing deportation without normal due process. There are several problems with using the Alien Enemies Act to justify these deportations:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;To be invoked, the United States must be at war with the foreign nation or government that is invading or threatening to invade the United States. But Tren de Aragua is a criminal organization, or perhaps a terrorist organization, and the United States cannot declare war against a non-nation. Furthermore, neither Venezuela nor Tren de Aragua have perpetrated, attempted, or threatened an invasion of the United States.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;Donald Trump has claimed that he didn&#39;t sign the proclamation invoking the Alien Enemies Act, even though it is in the Federal Register with his signature attached to it. Trump tried to throw Marco Rubio under the bus, telling reporters to as the Secretary of State because &quot;I&#39;m not really involved in that.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has repeatedly claimed that dead people are receiving social security benefits. So, he and his rats have &quot;fixed the glitch&quot; and cut off payments to at least one dead man still receiving benefits. Oh, and they went ahead and withdrew money from his bank account to recover past social security benefits paid out.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The problem is, he&#39;s not dead. In fact, he&#39;s very much alive, and has been forced to spend weeks trying to sort out the mess DOGE created. And the false claim of his death will probably continue to plague him for the rest of his life.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&quot;I was thinking that if I was living solely off Social Security, I could be close to dumpster diving about now,&quot; said Leonard Johnson, the man falsely accused of being dead. &quot;I&#39;m OK with mistakes being made. But I&#39;m not sure how much they&#39;re focused on fixing these kinds of mistakes going forward, as they are in using the mistakes to tear the place down.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

Schmidt is a permanent legal resident with a green card in good standing. His abuse apparently came when his green card was &quot;flagged&quot; for unknown reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Schmidt is only one of many legal residents in the United States who are being attacked by the Trump regime on false charges. Many foreign nationals, whether residents of the U.S. or visitors, have reported being detained and abused by immigration officials for no valid reasons. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This seems to be the new status quo: The people who might possibly stand up to the Trump regime have all proven to be remarkably apathetic. In this article, acting SSA commissioner Dudek essentially sums up his own actions with this phrase: &quot;I work for the president. I need to do what the president tells me to do.&quot; It&#39;s worth noting that acting director of the SSA is not a position Dudek is trained for or actively sought out. In fact, he never thought he would hold such a role, which may help explain, but not justify, why he isn&#39;t resisting.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is oddly reminiscent of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8OFrDQkfjM&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Schumer&#39;s sudden flip&lt;/a&gt; on last week&#39;s CR when he suddenly decided that giving in to the Republicans would somehow put them in a position where they would have to start negotiating with Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I am not calling this a conspiracy, but if this were a James Bond movie, you know the only possible explanation would be that the &quot;bad guys&quot; had some sort of mind control device that they were using to keep potential agitators under control.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Sarah Inama, a sixth-grade history teacher in Idaho, was ordered to remove two signs from her classroom. One sign contained the words &quot;Everyone is welcome here,&quot; above several raised hands of different skin tones. The other sign says &quot;In this room everyone is welcome important accepted respected encouraged valued equal.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Inama was told to remove the signs because they &quot;violated district policy.&quot; School officials said that &quot;Everyone is welcome here is not something that everyone believes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Chief Academic Officer Marcus Myers said that he had no problem with the wording on the sign, but that the depiction if different skin colors combined with the text turned it into a personal opinion. Apparently, it&#39;s only OK to say, &quot;Everyone is welcome&quot; when you don&#39;t actually mean &lt;i&gt;everyone&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I joined with thousands of my neighbors to hear Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders speak out against the oligarchy. Sanders noted that, &quot;a few years ago, when I used the word &#39;oligarchy,&#39; people didn&#39;t know what I was talking about. Well. they know what I&#39;m talking about now. You got to be dumb, blind, and deaf not to see what&#39;s going on.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Everywhere the tour goes, the two champions of democracy are drawing record crowds. Opposition to Donald Trump is rising, and, with the right leaders to guide our paths, the people will rise up and eliminate the greatest threat to our national security we have ever witnessed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;No matter how the next few weeks, months, or years play out, the effects of Trump&#39;s dismantling of our government will drastically alter life as we know it for years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As we stand up against the Trump regime, we need to realize that we don&#39;t want to restore the United States of America to where it was before Trump took his second term in office because that would bring us right back to a place where we gladly hand our country over to an enemy of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Instead, we need to create something new. Something where it&#39;s the people, not the government, not the tech-bros, and not the corporations, who chart the course our country will take into the future.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Robert Reich outlines the three rules for fighting fear and intimidation he&#39;s learned from conversations with people living under oppressive regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Do not give in:&lt;/b&gt; Fear only works if people are intimidated.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Join others and speak out:&lt;/b&gt; Find safety in numbers. One voice can be ignored, but it&#39;s harder to silence or oppress the masses.&lt;/li&gt;
                &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Everyone&lt;/i&gt; has to support these efforts:&lt;/b&gt; To the extent possible, we all need to support those standing up to and speaking out against the oppression.&lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We each have our own strengths and weaknesses, our own limits to what we can do or what we can endure. These are general guidelines to be followed to the extent that we are able, weighing our personal well-being against our duty to protect our fellow compatriots.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s easy to complain about those who are supposed to represent our interests in the government. But do you think you have what it takes to do better? Learn how to run for local office, and get the support and encouragement you need to &quot;Run for something.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The belief that the president has the authority to withhold (or impound) funds that have been appropriated by Congress is based on misconceptions and lies spread by an organization founded by OMB Director Russ Vought. Legally and historically, the president is &lt;i&gt;obligated&lt;/i&gt; to follow Congress&#39; spending instructions.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While there are certain limited cases where the president can &lt;i&gt;temporarily&lt;/i&gt; withhold Congressional appropriations, there is no provision for him to simply refuse to spend the money. The president can request a rescission of funds he does not want to spend, but unless both the House and Senate approve the request, the administration has to release the funds.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has signaled that it is willing to enter into a 30-day ceasefire if Russia is willing to accept. That is excellent news, as any pause in this war will be a welcome respite and will save lives. Russia and Ukraine will both use any potential ceasefire to re-position their troops and reinforce their positions to gain advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Russia will likely make a large push forward to gain new territory, then sign the ceasefire to give them time to fortify their position to better hold that territory. The main reason Ukraine would agree to the ceasefire is to continue receiving U.S. intelligence about Russian movements.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;The problem is that Donald Trump is a terrible businessman. He has no idea how to run a business, as indicated by the economic policies he is advancing right now, which can only be described as &quot;insane.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

While they try to pick up the pieces of their shattered lives, some of them are facing relatives who are cheering their unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trump loyalists blindly adhere to the belief that these layoffs have something to do with cutting waste out of our government, even if it is their own family members who are being called &quot;parasites&quot; by a madman who has become the richest man in the world by grifting off of the hard working employees in the companies he owns.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Protecting our own people, especially our most vulnerable people, from economic, health, and safety issues caused by industrial pollution can never be legitimately considered fraud, waste, or abuse. This move is just another in a long line of examples of our government telling its people: &quot;We don&#39;t care about you.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Congressional Republicans drafted a continuing resolution (CR) to avoid a government shutdown this week. That&#39;s not at all unusual these days, but this CR includes provisions that take away Congress&#39; &quot;power of the purse&quot; and gives the Trump regime authority to decide where the government funding is spent.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The net result: Republicans have chosen to take power away from democratically-elected members of Congress and hand it over to the un-elected bureaucrat, Elon Musk. Musk has already dismantled many of the major institutions of democracy in this country, and this bill gives him even more power to continue this wanton destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has increased the U.S. budget deficit to record levels already, after only 2 months in office.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trump has been claiming that he would make fiscal responsibility a priority, even creating the sham government agency called the &lt;i&gt;Department of Government Efficiency.&lt;/i&gt; But instead of saving us money, his regime has left us with a massive budget shortfall in his first months in office.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For Donald Trump&#39;s first full month in office (February, 2025), the budget deficit was $307 billion, 4% over last February.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;On March 9, a recent Columbia University graduate by the name of Mahmoud Khalil was detained by out-of-uniform ICE agents who did not identify themselves and displayed no warrant. His wife, who witnessed and recorded the arrest, compares it to a kidnapping.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Khalil has been a vocal advocate for Palestinian rights, and has led or helped organize several legal pro-Palestine and antiwar protests.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump continues to show his absolute disregard for the rights of his people by withdrawing federal funds from universities where protests occur, arresting protesters, and deporting legal residents. The American people (including foreign nationals legally residing in the United States) have not only a right, but a responsibility to protest unjust actions when we see them. Donald Trump has no right to block, punish, or threaten people who protest his actions, but he&#39;s doing it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Congress voted to pass the Republicans&#39; corrupt continuing resolution (CR) described &lt;a href=&quot;#CR&quot;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;. While the bill was introduced by and supported by Republicans, it could not have passed without Democratic support, which it received.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The United States was founded on the principle of a separation of powers between three branches of government. Over time, these branches have been abdicating their power for short-term, personal gain. Never has this been so blatant as this vote for the CR.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is an act of cowardice on the part of everyone who supported the bill. These MOCs gave up the power granted to them by the Constitution so they would not have to bear responsibility. Since the Judicial branch has already given up it&#39;s power by declaring that the president is above the law, this is effectively the end of the separation of powers in this country.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;One of our three dogs suffered from a rapid decline in health this week. She is a fifteen-year-old chihuahua, and suddenly stopped eating and lost most of her motor functions. Our family has been taking turns watching her and assisting her as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Over the past few days, her health has improved, and she is eating again and able to walk, somewhat, without assistance. But she still requires monitoring as she is prone to falling down and not being able to get back up again.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I was able to set up a new account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethepeopleus.substack.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Substack&lt;/a&gt; and create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@free-the-people-us&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channel for &lt;b&gt;free-the-people.us&lt;/b&gt;, but there is no content on either account at this time.

            &lt;p&gt;House Resolution 22, also know as the &quot;Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act&quot; or the &quot;SAVE Act,&quot; allegedly makes elections more secure by requiring proof of citizenship when registering to vote.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But in reality, this bill is intended to make it more difficult to vote, especially for the poor, women, and new citizens, exactly the demographics the Republican party seeks to disenfranchise.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest blow would be to women who legally changed their names when they got married. Under the SAVE Act, since their birth certificate would not match their current legal name, as many as 69 million American women would be unable to register to vote or update their registration status.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This bill would also effectively halt all third-party voter registration initiatives and online voter registration, disenfranchising millions of Americans.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;It must be because we never had a way of identifying and stopping fraud, waste, and abuse in our government before, right?&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Wrong. The paltry savings that DOGE has created are just random cuts, and have nothing to do with eliminating fraud, waste, or abuse. But there have always been people in our government who &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; find and eliminate fraud, waste, and abuse. And they&#39;re good at what they do. Or, at least they were, before they were fired.&lt;/p&gt;

Trump starts a foolish trade war with America&#39;s closest allies that will hurt our people more than theirs while silently building a police state to keep us in line. Trump tries to scare Americans out of protesting his tyrannical regime and punishes citizens and foreign nationals who don&#39;t speak English. The stock market crashes while the military is ordered to delete any parts of our history that might possibly be related to DEI initiatives.

                    &lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;You show contempt for poor and middle-class Americans, allowing Elon Musk to dismantle agencies they rely on while he prances around the Oval Office and you sit inert at your desk. You place unqualified lackeys in charge of those agencies. You have contempt for anyone more loyal to God and country than to you, ask Mike Pence. Your tax cut in 2017 yielded hundreds of millions of dollars for your billionaire friends and pennies for the middle-class blue-collar families that make America great. You intend to do it again: to take benefits from those who have the least to sate the gluttony of the rich.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Republican representatives continue to be booed by their constituents in town halls across the country for their support of tyranny.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Keep up the pressure: These cowards are supporting Trump out of fear of being primaried in their next elections. We need to make it clear that if they don&#39;t stop this tyranny, we will primary them.&lt;/p&gt;

                    Justice is catching up to Trump
                &lt;/a&gt;
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Trump regime&#39;s onslaught of stupidity is finally starting to slow as courts are catching up with him. Sending immigrants to Guantanamo, selling off government-owned facilities, mass layoffs of federal workers, and the removal of government watchdogs are all being reversed by the courts because they are illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;div style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;&gt;
            &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Te62RQTevgo?si=-vWkukfdNHF7ACNo&quot; title=&quot;YouTube video player&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&quot; referrerpolicy=&quot;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
            &lt;/div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;While this is good news, and a step in the right direction, it&#39;s worth noting that these reversals are not permanent, and many people who do not lose their jobs or are re-hired are likely to be fired again once the Trump administration figures out how to do so legally. Don&#39;t assume this means Trump has been defeated, or that his attack on America has ended.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.forwardparty.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Forward party&lt;/a&gt; was formed in 2022. Unlike the Republican or Democratic parties, which only accept right- or left-aligned members, respectively, the Forward party welcomes members with diverse views representing a wide swath of the political spectrum. Instead of dictating policy positions based on their appeal to extreme conservative or liberal ideologies, Forward promotes policies that bring power back to the voters.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Many Americans choose the candidiates they vote for not on their own merit, but because they don&#39;t want the &quot;other&quot; party to win. Out of more than 500,000 elected positions in the United States, 70% of them go uncontested because the candidates are in a decidedly red or blue district and they know the voters won&#39;t vote for the &quot;other&quot; party. So they only have to appeal to the most extreme members of their own party who vote in the primary elections to seal their victory in the general election.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The Forward party seeks to change that, forcing representatives to represent the majority of their constituents, regardless of political affiliation or ideology. They seek to accomplish this by advocating for voter-empowering policies like independent redistricting committees, nonpartisan primaries, and ranked-choice voting.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trade war Donald Trump has started with our neighbors, our (former) friends, and our (former) allies is actually illegal. Congress, not the president, has the power to enact tariffs. The president is only allowed to alter tariffs for national security reasons. And there is absolutely no national security risk from Canada or Mexico that justifies this attack on our largest economic partners in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Trump&#39;s claim that these tariffs are in response to fentanyl &quot;pouring into&quot; our country through these borders is a desparate attempt to legitimize his xenophobia. In the case of Canada, his claims are nothing more than a lie, since we only have evidence of a few dozen kilos of fentanyl coming across that &lt;i&gt;enormous&lt;/i&gt; border. As for Mexico, fentanyl is admittedly a problem, but not one that justifies or can be solved by antagonizing the Mexican people and hurting American consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has previously announced plans to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAkiKP_QrB8&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;force-relocate&lt;/a&gt; homeless people to tent-cities on &quot;inexpensive lands&quot; where there would be doctors, psychiatrists, social workers, and drug rehab specialists available to the residents. To date, he has not established any such facilities.&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;This week, he threatened to take over D.C. from Mayor Muriel Bowser if she didn&#39;t &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/trump-says-dc-must-clear-unsightly-homeless-encampments/3860501/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;clean up the unsightly homeless encampments&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; People are being forced to leave their encampments, but are not being offered access to any alternative facilities or treatments, and will undoubtedly establish a new encampment in a nearby location because evacuating people from a place does not make them cease to exist, nor does it make them any less homeless.&lt;/p&gt; 
           &lt;p&gt;In Finland, those experiencing homelessness are treated very differently. Homeless people receive a small apartment to live in, along with support services, with no conditions attached. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://thebetter.news/interview-juha-kahila-housing-first-finnland/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Housing First&lt;/a&gt; initiative provides people who lose their home with respectable accomodations right away, as well as job opportunities if they need them.&lt;/p&gt;
           &lt;p&gt;And here&#39;s the real kicker: providing the homeless with housing, support services, and job opportunities actually &lt;i&gt;saves taxpayers money.&lt;/i&gt; That&#39;s not only true in Finland, but all around the world: &quot;It is always cheaper to house people with support than to leave them in emergency shelters or on the streets.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump is dismantling the institutions of our democracy, but make no mistake, this is not about shrinking the size of our government. Because while the regime is breaking down institutions that give power to the people, they are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/05/trump-welfare-police-state-government-layoffs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;building up institutions&lt;/a&gt; that take power away from the people.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;It seems that law enforcement, border security, national security, and immigration enforcement are immune from massive layoffs. In fact, Republicans are proposing &lt;i&gt;increasing&lt;/i&gt; funding for these exempt institutions by $300 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The money saved by the unprecidented and illegal cuts to our institutions by Musk and his rats in DOGE are liable to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/how-doge-irs-cuts-will-cost-more-than-savings-trump-musk-deficit&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;cost more&lt;/a&gt; than they will save.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Complex tax returns, such as those filed by large corporations and wealthy individuals, require scrutiny from well-trained and experienced tax professionals. We&#39;ve typically had a shortage of such specialists, meaning many of these complex filings are accepted without challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Studies have shown that for every dollar spent by the IRS, the United States gains $5 to $12. Despite this, DOGE is making sweeping cuts to the IRS, including laying off the skilled personnel needed to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This was never about efficiency, it was about making it easier for the wealthy in this country to steal from the poor.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;

                        On March 4, citizens all around the nation gathered to protest the Trump regime&#39;s hostile government takeover. Ever the coward, Donald Trump desperately tries to bully anyone who disagrees with him.
                    &lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;
                        Pre-threatening institutions of learning about what will happen to them if they &quot;allow&quot; illegal protests is a desperate attempt to frighten them into not allowing &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; protests at all, which is the end goal of all fascists.

        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For 249 years, the United States of America has had no official language. But that changed this week by another ill-conceived &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-declare-english-official-language-5b24f6ac1172803f615cea69e13f8724&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; from Donald Trump. This country is&amp;mdash;and always has been&amp;mdash;a country of immigrants. Today, there are over 350 languages spoken within the United States. Making English the official language does nothing to benefit English speakers, but it takes rights and opportunities &lt;i&gt;away&lt;/i&gt; from the countless citizens and foreign nationals who do not read or speak English fluently.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Anabel Mendoza, representative of the immigrant advoracy organization &lt;i&gt;United We Dream&lt;/i&gt; had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;
                &quot;Trump is trying to send the message that if you&#39;re not white, rich and speak English you don&#39;t belong here. Let me be clear: Immigrants are here to stay. No matter how hard Trump tries, he can&#39;t erase us.&quot;

            &lt;p&gt;In an attempt to &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/dei-purge-images-pentagon-diversity-women-black-8efcfaec909954f4a24bad0d49c78074&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;erase our heritage&lt;/a&gt;, The Trump regime has started deleting historical records from our archives.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Like their other idiotic moves, this is not carried out with precision, but rashly deletes as much as possible as quickly as possible. Photograghs of the &lt;i&gt;Enola Gay&lt;/i&gt; aircraft that carried and dropped the first atomic bomb ever used in warfare were marked for deletion because of the name &quot;Gay,&quot; even though the plane was named after the pilot&#39;s mother, and this is a common surname in the United States. Photographs of female and minority service members are being forever removed from our history.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Apparently, it&#39;s not enough to end the highly successful and wildly popular DEI initiatives this country has made over the past decades. Now they&#39;re removing even the &lt;i&gt;record&lt;/i&gt; of past successes.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            On Tuesday, March 4th, my partner and I participated in our first-ever protest at our state&#39;s capital. We joined hundreds of like-minded citizens to protest the despicable acts of the current oligarchy.
            &lt;p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I have to say I was quite surprised by how peaceful and friendly my fellow protestors were. We are all infuriated by the way this regime has been attacking our democracy and our decency as a nation. Yet we were able to meet together in solidarity to raise our voice against tyranny and march together peacefully to make our voices heard.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This was also the first time our &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america/&quot;&gt;disgraced flag&lt;/a&gt; was flown publicly. A lot of people asked about it, and I was more than happy to explain the symbolism, but I now realize I should have brought flyers with me to hand out because sometimes it was hard to hear one another in the crowd.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Do you want to join the next protest? A great resource for information about events in cities near you is &lt;a href=&quot;https://linktr.ee/fiftyfiftyonemovement&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fiftyfifty.one&lt;/a&gt;. It&#39;s time to get &lt;b&gt;loud&lt;/b&gt; to save our nation before it&#39;s too late.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

        &lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Sunday, March 9th, my partner and I hit the protest lines again, this time with our two grown children. This protest was specifically to show Ukraine that the people of this nation stand beside them, and that we apologize for the horrendous treatment the war hero President Volodymyr Zelenskyy received from Donald Trump and his mini-me in the Oval Office on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;February 28th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is not how the United States of America should treat its allies. Hell, this isn&#39;t even an acceptable way to treat our worst enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;We stand with Ukraine! Slava Ukraini! Heroiam Slava!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/td&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Republicans are talking about privatizing the Post Office, among other things. Sounds harmless enough...after all, why use the taxpayer&#39;s money to pay for something that could make money for itself?&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Many of the nation&#39;s greatest achievements have come from public works paid for by taxpayer&#39;s money. Do you like free roads, free parking, and free public libraries? How about subsidies for in-state college tuition and guaranteed mail delivery even in the most rural parts of the United States? These things were made possible by massive public investments in our nation, not by greedy corporations whose only goal is to generate money for their shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: The United States joins the Axis of Evil and Trump and Vance disgrace the nation on the world stage, destroying our relationship with our former allies around the world. Gaza gives Trump the finger for releasing a video where he takes over Gaza and is idolized for it. GOP representatives allow their constituents to be bullied and brutalized in front of them, while members of Congress declare that federal employees do not deserve their jobs or their paychecks. Join the resistance by calling your representatives and telling them to vote no on the SAVE act, join the March 4th for Democracy protests, or any of the numerous protests happening every day all across the country, and take courses in civil resistance or protecting voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The Good&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-transparent table-shadow&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;

        &lt;img class=&quot;img-link&quot; alt=&quot;Image of a Palestinian solder in combat gear accepting a rose being handed to him by a young boy amidst a pile of rubble on a Gazan street.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; src=&quot;/images/kXK279zCWD-200.webp&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; height=&quot;196&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;&quot;Gaza is ours, forever strong. A land of hope, where we belong.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In response to the disgusting, narcissistic, and anti-Palestinian &lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/7262241/trump-gaza-ai-video-truth-social-resorts-netanyahu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;AI video&lt;/a&gt; released on Donald Trump&#39;s Truth Social account, young people of Gaza have created their own AI-generated response video.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;https://countercurrents.org/2025/02/gaza-youth-release-powerful-counter-video-to-trumps-racist-ai-propaganda/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the response&lt;/a&gt;, we see a bright future ahead for the people of Gaza, but one that they build for themselves where they are definitely &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; worshipping a giant golden statue of Donald Trump (minus all the fat rolls).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center&quot;&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Because Congress does not allow remote voting, Colorado District 7 Representative Brittany Pettersen flew to D.C. with her 4-week-old son so she could stand with fellow Democrats and vote no on the budget proposal.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the video on the left, released on Feb 24, 2025, Donald Trump says this of the USMCA trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico, among other trade deals:&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;I look at some of these agreements, I read them at night, and I&#39;d say, who would ever sign something like this?&quot;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p style=&quot;clear:left;&quot;&gt;In the video on the right, released October 6, 2018, Donald Trump says of the USMCA trade agreement between the United States, Canada, and Mexico: &quot;It&#39;s my great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So I guess we can safely answer your question...YOU would sign something like this.&lt;/p&gt;        
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

Their reason for resigning?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;We will not use our skills as technologists to compromise core government systems, jeopardize Americans&#39; sensitive data, or dismantle critical public services. We will not lend our expertise to carry out or legitimize DOGE&#39;s actions.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The federal Department of Education is threatening to take funding away from schools that teach diversity intiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Illinois public schools &lt;a href=&quot;https://wgntv.com/news/illinois/illinois-schools-lgbtq-history-state-superintendent/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;refuse to be bullied&lt;/a&gt;, and have announced that they will continue teaching students about the contributions of the LGBTQ+ community, citing the state&#39;s &lt;i&gt;Inclusive Curriculum Implementation Guidance:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;To create an equitable society that is inclusive and affirming for people of all sexual orientations and gender identities, it is necessary to teach young people the roles and contributions of the LGBTQ+ community.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div style=&quot;display:flex;&quot;&gt;

        &lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 5px;flex-shrink:1&quot;&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Alsup tells the Office of Personnel Management to rescind its directives to fire probationary employees in the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Park Service, the Small Business Administration, the Bureau of Land Management, the Department of Defense, and the Fish and Wildlife Service.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;OPM does not have authority to fire employees from other agencies. Defense attorney&#39;s argued that OPM was merely asking the other agencies to terminate employees, but Judge Alsup felt that the speed at which the terminations took place made it all too apparent that this was an order.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;In another &quot;Friday Night Massacre&quot; on February 21, Donald Trump &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/hegseth-defends-jag-firings-unpersuasive-way-possible-rcna193423&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;fired&lt;/a&gt; the country&#39;s highest-ranking military officer, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman CQ Brown Jr. He also fired Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti and Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General James Slife.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But he didn&#39;t stop there. His administration also announced that they&#39;re firing top military Judge Advocates General (JAG).&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Why fire these exemplary defenders of our once-great nation? Obviously it&#39;s to make room to replace them with more bootlickers willing to support a tyrant and unwilling to defend the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Our armed forces are weaker, and our democracy is less protected without these and other watchdogs in the federal government who are there specifically to prevent a power-grab like the one we are currently seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On February 24, 2025, the United States officially &lt;a href=&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/24/politics/us-joins-russia-ukraine-un-vote&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;joined the Axis of Evil&lt;/a&gt; when it sided with Russia, North Korea, and Belarus to vote &lt;b&gt;against&lt;/b&gt; a resolution condemning Russia for the Ukraine war.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has completely sold our country to Vladimir Putin. And the worst part is, we don&#39;t seem to even get anything in return.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Combined with the disastrous debacle in the Oval Office on Friday, February 28 (See &lt;i&gt;The Ugly&lt;/i&gt; section below), it is clear that Donald Trump is nothing more than Putin&#39;s puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td width=&quot;200px&quot; class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;

          1958 UNESCO postage stamp
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On February 14, the White House barred access to all A.P. journalists for no reason other than their refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico by the incorrect and idiotic name, &lt;i&gt;Gulf of America&lt;/i&gt;. On February 25, the White House &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/white-house-journalists-access-to-trump/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;went even further&lt;/a&gt;, announcing that it was going to pick and choose which media outlets were given the opportunity to cover the president in close quarters. The selection of journalists allowed into these spaces has traditionally been performed by the White House Correspondents Association.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite the fact that this decision was made right after barring the Associated Press, the White House claims that this affront to the freedom of the press was enacted to give more and new outlets a chance to take part in the press pool.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just how dumb do they think the American people are?&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The most disgraceful display in the history of the United States took place on Friday, February 28, 2025. Another &lt;b&gt;date which will live in infamy.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The entire world was shocked when Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum in the Oval Office because Volodymyr Zelenskyy wasn&#39;t being nice enough to &lt;b&gt;Vladimir Putin!&lt;/b&gt; Trump seemed surprised that Zelenskyy didn&#39;t seem to like the president of the nation that invaded his land and killed his people.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The United States is now an enemy of freedom, justice, and democracy. We have been forever shamed by this abhorrent display of weakness, cowardice, and disrespect.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td colspan=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In an appaling display of brutality, three men dragged Teresa Borrenpohl out of a town hall meeting in Coeur d&#39;Alene, Idaho. The men were repeatedly asked to identify themselves and give some indication of their authority to drag Teresa out of her seat, but refused to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Town hall attendees were angry with the representatives on stage, and several attendees were shouting out questions or criticisms when they were scolded by a disrespectful and arrogant moderator for &quot;popping off with stupid remarks.&quot; The moderator continued delivering a slew of insults aimed at the attendees, who collectively booed the moderator, but were unable to silence him. Enraged at the lack of respect these so-called representatives showed their constituents, Teresa asked, &quot;Is this a town hall, or a lecture?&quot; While the other attendees cheered Teresa&#39;s response, a local sheriff told Teresa to leave or be arrested. Meanwhile, the moderator continued delivering a non-stop deluge of insults at Teresa and the crowd in an attempt to distract the crowd&#39;s attention away from the injustice being carried out, including stating that Teresa was, a &quot;little girl,&quot; and &quot;afraid to leave.&quot; He even goes so far as to say, &quot;She spoke up, and now she doesn&#39;t want to suffer the consequences.&quot; He failed to explain why anyone should face consequences for speaking up in a town hall.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the sheriff was unable to talk Teresa into leaving the meeting, he called over three unidentified men wearing unmarked street clothes and then cowardly took out his cell phone, retreated to a safe distance, and started recording a video as these unidentified men grabbed Teresa and dragged her forcefully out of her chair. Teresa asked them repeatedly, &quot;who are you?&quot; They never answered the question. Teresa then turned to the sheriff and told him that she was being assaulted. Instead of coming to her aid, identifying these men, or providing any justification or official authorization for their actions, he simple continued recording, grunting, &quot;you out now,&quot; while cowering safely away from the assault taking place in front of him. She asked the sheriff if these men were his deputies, and he refused to respond or offer any indication of their identity or affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a shocking display of people in positions of power treating the citizens they are supposed to be serving with utter contempt. Or, should I say, people in positions of power sending in their goons to mistreat the citizens they are supposed to be serving while they sit idly by in safety, pretending they are not responsible.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has this to say to federal workers in the United States:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;indent&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Those are not real jobs producing federal revenue. By the way, they are consuming taxpayer dollars. Those jobs are paid for by the American tax people who work real jobs, earn real income, pay federal taxes, and then pay these federal employees. Federal employees do not deserve their jobs. Federal employees do not deserve their paychecks.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You should be ashamed of yourself Marjorie. We are certainly ashamed of you.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;

        Feb. 28 Economic Blackout
      &lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;On Friday, February 28, I joined my family and fellow patriots around the country in a one-day boycott of large corporations. I did not buy anything or visit any online or brick-and-mortar stores that day.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The impact of this boycott was probably largely unnoticed by the targeted corporations. I&#39;m sure it made a small dent in their average daily sales, but probably did nothing to actually affect their bottom lines.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;But the point of this boycott was not to hurt corporate America. Instead, the point was to rally people to see if we could get a significant portion of the population to participate in an event like this. If it is possible to get enough people engaged, we might be able to enact some longer-term, more targeted boycotts that might actually have some level of impact.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;For example, continuing or doubling-down on the current boycott of Target stores might pressure them into reinstating the DEI hiring policies they &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/19/business/target-dei-boycott/index.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rolled back&lt;/a&gt; out of fear that Donald Trump might &quot;investigate&quot; them. After George Floyd was murdered by police in 2020, Target became a leader in promoting DEI practices and gained a reputation as being a progressive employer. But they were also among the first companies to do an about-face in their policies as soon as Trump was elected.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

      &lt;/td&gt; 
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, February 26, I published the first opinion piece on this website, titled, &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;/articles/fort-knox/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Trump and  Musk to Visit Fort Knox&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;On February 20, Donald Trump revealed that he is planning a visit to Fort Knox to see &quot;if the gold is still there.&quot; With all of the horrible things that have happened over the past week, this is probably the least significant story, and it was quickly (and appropriately) drowned out in the torrent of disgrace pouring out of the White House every day.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But something struck me about this statement, so I felt compelled to write this short article to document my suspicion that Trump made this statement to try to distract the press, but may have inadvertently revealed his upcoming plans to claim that someone (Probably Joe Biden or &quot;the Democrats&quot; in general) has stolen America&#39;s gold. I believe he will make this claim in an attempt to take the gold himself, or share it with Musk and/or Putin.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s a wild claim on my part, and probably (hopefully) is completely unjustified. But I wanted to write it down just in case it actually happens sometime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;

          Civil Resistance Course
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This week, I signed up for the self-paced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usip.org/academy/catalog/civil-resistance-1-dynamics-nonviolent-movements&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Civil Resistance 1: The Dynamics of Nonviolent Movements&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; course from the United States Institute of Peace.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I&#39;m not sure how long this course will be available before Musk&#39;s rats devour the USIP along with every other government agency targeted for reduction or elimination by Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But for now, I am looking forward to participating in the course. I have only completed the introduction so far, and have not yet started the true course content, which I will be participating in in the week ahead.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What can you do in the week ahead?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;table class=&quot;table table-transparent table-shadow&quot;&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;House Republicans are pushing a bill, called the SAVE Act that intends to disenfranchise millions of eligible American voters.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Under the guise of election security, the SAVE Act would require proof of citizenship to be presented to register to vote. When that&#39;s all you hear, it sounds very reasonable. But there are problems with this:&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Not everyone can access these documents (They are frequently lost or destroyed)&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;They must be presented in person, eliminating online and mail-in voter registration&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;It would prevent most married women from being able to register to vote if they changed their names when they married&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;It makes it easier to intimidate and add barriers to naturalized citizens&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;It just makes it harder in general, so fewer people will register to vote&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Indivisible has an &lt;a href=&quot;https://indivisible.org/resource/call-now-tell-your-representative-vote-no-save-act&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;online form&lt;/a&gt; you can fill out to get connected directly to your representative so you can tell them to vote NO on this dangerous bill.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, March 4th, people will gather at their state capitals or nearest cities to join the fight to uphold the Constitution and end executive overreach.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are many protests happening every day all across the nation. But we&#39;re pushing the &quot;March forth&quot;/&quot;March fourth&quot; protest because it is a generalized protest instead of a targeted protest (There have been protests at Tesla factories targeting Elon Musk and DOGE, protests at ICE agencies protesting immigration intimidation and racism, protests targeting women&#39;s rights, LGBTQ+ rights, Black Lives Matter, support for Ukraine, opposition to the genocide in Gaza, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to sign up for a protest in a city near you, you can find valuable resources along with a list of local events on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fiftyfifty.one&quot;&gt;50501 website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        <summary>Recap of this week in the revolution. Trump does more damage in 30 days in office than any other enemy in history, the resistance finds a new anthem in Hostile Government Takeover by A Gift from Todd, more Republicans openly display the Nazi salute to cheering crowds, Trump supporters start to realize that Trump&#39;s policies are as damaging to them as they are to the rest of the country, and Free the People launches a new merch store to sell the disgraced flag of the United States. Join the fight by participating in the February 28 blackout, taking a Minute of US at 12:53 pm every Wednesday, or joining an Indivisible.org Zoom call to find out &quot;What&#39;s the plan?&quot;</summary>

&lt;p&gt;This is my first attempt at at a recap of the past week&#39;s events, and I just thought of it yesterday, so it might be a bit awkward or self-serving, and it probably won&#39;t contain that much to interest you. But hopefully over time I can build this concept into a useful or at least entertaining resource for the resistance.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Donald Trump has now been in his second presidential term for more than 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In just one month, this man has done more damage to the United States of America than all of our enemies, combined, have been able to do over the course of the last 250 years.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;

          Empires have fallen before. But it&#39;s never been this purely idiotic.

        &lt;p&gt;Author Ryan Cooper compares the current collapse of the United States to the collapse of empires in the past. While all empires eventually fall, even the most incompetent leaders in history have never managed to bungle their countries so badly.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t think this was just released this week, but I first heard about it this week...&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mapquest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MapQuest&lt;/a&gt; launched a new interactive &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulfof.mapquest.com/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Name your own gulf&lt;/a&gt; tool to allow &lt;i&gt;anyone&lt;/i&gt; to re-name the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, February 18, Donald Trump announced that the Associated Press would no longer be allowed to attend his news conferences because they refuse to call the Gulf of Mexico by the stupid name he came up with for it.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Yeah, right, Donny. I&#39;m sure &lt;b&gt;that&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; why you don&#39;t want the Associated Press around.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The harder Trump fights against people who don&#39;t kneel to his misguided sense of self-worth, the more people can see through his stupidity to the scared little boy that he is.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;Republican leaders around the nation are begging Trump to leave &lt;i&gt;their&lt;/i&gt; programs and people alone, hoping that they will survive the downfall of the country and only the &quot;others&quot; will have to feel the pain.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td width=&quot;100%&quot;&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Today was the first time I tried flying the &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america/&quot;&gt;Disgraced Flag of the United States of America&lt;/a&gt;. This flag is &lt;b&gt;Free the People&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; symbol of protest against the current oligarchy, and one we&#39;re sharing with others who may be interested.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I bought the prototype flag from our new &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethepeople.printify.me/product/18125125/the-disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america&quot; target=&quot;store&quot;&gt;Printify&lt;/a&gt; merch store. The flag came out very well, and is of high quality. In fact, the material is so thick and heavy, I was afraid it wouldn&#39;t fly, but it did a nice job with the breeze that was blowing. I think I&#39;ll look around for another provider who might be able to print a flag on even lighter material to ensure it will fly in even the lightest breeze, but this works well enough for now.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The total cost (including tax and shipping) was $31.54. If you use &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethepeople.printify.me/product/18125125/the-disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america&quot; target=&quot;store&quot;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; and select the 36&quot; x 60&quot; option, you should be able to get it at a similar price (Though your taxes and shipping will be slightly different from mine). I do not receive any money for flags ordered from that link...you just pay the cost to print it and ship it directly to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;It took 11 days from the time I ordered the flag until I received it, and for most of that time the tracking number showed that the label was printed, but the package had not been received by the post office. That tells me that it was made in China and shipped overseas before hitting the post office, even though the provider was listed as being in the United States. I have no objection to ordering products from China, but thought I&#39;d mention it on case you do.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This week, I also opened &lt;b&gt;Free the People&#39;s&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://freethepeople.printify.me/&quot; target=&quot;store&quot;&gt;merch store&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href=&quot;https://printify.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Printify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;We wanted a store primarily to sell the &lt;a href=&quot;/articles/disgraced-flag-of-the-united-states-of-america&quot;&gt;Disgraced Flag of the United States of America&lt;/a&gt; to anyone who might want a copy. But while I was setting it up, I did make a couple other products for us to sell just for fun. We will probably add additional merchandise over time as we think of ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;Everything in the store comes in two variants: One is sold at-cost (I/we receive absolutely no money from your order), and the other has a markup (25-35%) that is paid to me, Doug Lockwood, directly. This gives people the option to provide a small donation if they like what we have to offer, but is by no means obligatory. If I do receive any donations, I will either spend them on resources to improve this website, the tools we will offer to fellow resistance fighters, or re-donate them to the organizations that are fighting against the current oligarchy.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The pin is just the &lt;b&gt;Free the People&lt;/b&gt; logo. I&#39;m not sure why you&#39;d want to wear our logo around, but hey, whatever floats your boat!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;I do particularly like the notebook. On the cover, it has the disgraced flag and says...&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:0.5rem;&quot;&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;This is my plan to...&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Defy and undermine the oligarchy&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Engage with my elected officials&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Fight for equal rights for ALL&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Elect leaders who uphold democracy&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Neutralize hate speech with empathy&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Demand accountability from leaders&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;That spells out &quot;DEFEND,&quot; so I call this my &quot;D.E.F.E.N.D. Democracy&quot; notebook. On the back it displays the proper American flag and says...&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;blockquote style=&quot;margin-left:0.5rem&quot;&gt;
        &lt;b&gt;And that&#39;s how I helped restore freedom and justice to the United States of America.&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;/blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;The hat has the disgraced flag on it with our &lt;a href=&quot;/about/vision&quot;&gt;vision&lt;/a&gt; statement overlaid in fancy script: &quot;Free the people of the United States in order to form a more perfect union.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;

        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This wasn&#39;t really released &lt;i&gt;this week,&lt;/i&gt; but I wanted to point out that we do make some of our digital resources, such as the disgraced flag images, available to anyone who might want to use them. The selection is sparse right now, but we do hope to add more assets over time as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can find our assets in this &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/free-the-people/assets&quot; target=&quot;github&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt;. These assets were previously licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International license, but this week, we removed the license restrictions. Our intention all along was to make these images available to the public to use how they like, so the license was not necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;What can &quot;you&quot; do over the next week?&lt;/h4&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;February 28, 2025:&lt;/b&gt; For one full day, avoid spending any money whatsoever at any major retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This isn&#39;t going to end the totalitarian regime we are under by any means. But if corporations start to feel their profits may decrease because the people are angry, they will turn against those in power. Since big corporations have more voice in the current government than the people do, it may be that the only way we can make our voices heard is by making &lt;i&gt;them&lt;/i&gt; speak for &lt;i&gt;us.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;b&gt;&quot;We refuse to tune out and instead bear witness in reflection, meditation, and prayer on the harms being done — so we can stay in motion together.&quot;&lt;/b&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Why 12:53 pm? That&#39;s the time when the January 6 protestors crossed the police baricades in 2021. It&#39;s also the time that the three richest men in the world were sitting at Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Each week, &lt;a href=&quot;https://indivisible.org/indivisible-trainings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Indivisible.org&lt;/a&gt; hosts a massive Zoom call to try to make some sense of the chaos we are all in and bring people together to process it all.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This as a massive, nationwide call, so it&#39;s not targeted to specific events or activities in your area, but the hosts do try to answer questions submitted in advance or during the call. They can&#39;t get to all of them, but they do a good job of cutting through the noise and encouraging real actions you can take.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
