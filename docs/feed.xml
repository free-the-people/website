		&lt;p&gt;No, that title is not a typo. Nor is it click-bait. It&#39;s actually true. The Nobel Peace Price is usually given to individuals  and sometimes to organizations that promote peace. But this year, Minneapolis, Minnesota, and its residents have collectively been nominated for the 2026 Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nominations were open until January 31, and will be reviewed by the Norwegian Nobel Committee through September. The winner will be announced in October, and the aware ceremony will be held in December.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;[Minneapolis] has met and exceeded the committee&#39;s standard of promoting democracy and human rights, and work aimed at creating a better organized and more peaceful world.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;[The people of Minneapolis have] suffered countless abuses, including harassment, detention, deportation, and injury.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;[In response to these incidents, Minneapolis leaders called for] nonviolent protest, in accordance with the U.S. Constitution’s promise that Americans have a right to assemble and petition for the redress of grievances.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The two agents who shot Alex Pretti in the streets of Minneapolis have been identified: Jesus Ochoa and Raymundo Gutierrez.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Both were employed by Customs and Border Protection and assigned to Operation Metro Surge, the Trump regime&#39;s unprecedented deployment of armed and masked agents sent to sow terror into the hearts and minds of the American public. The move has led to massive protests in Minneapolis and around the country.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem spread blatant lies about the execution of Pretti immediately after the incident, along with other representatives of the Trump regime. The government has tried to interfere with any investigation into the killing, despite the fact that videos of the event are readily available to the public that clearly expose the lies of the regime.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;These are the exact same tactics the regime tried to unsuccessfully employ after Renee Good was killed by Jonathan Ross just a few weeks earlier. But every time their lies are exposed, their support base weakens, their power is threatened, and public outrage grows. It remains to be seen whether the public outcry will ultimately lead to the toppling of the regime, or if they will be able to escalate their terror tactics enough to suppress any effective opposition to the regime&#39;s power.&lt;/p&gt;

The podium has the phrase &quot;One of ours, all of yours&quot; written on it. This is a Nazi slogan linked to a 1942 incident where Nazi soldiers massacred an entire village in the modern-day Czech Republic in retaliation for the death of an SS soldier who had been terrorizing the village.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After Noem lied to the public about the events leading to the murders of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by ICE agents who report to her, Democrats are telling Donny 2-Dolls to fire her. If he does not, they say they will file articles of impeachment.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;So far, Trump&#39;s bootlickers are (predictably) defending both Noem and the regime&#39;s actions. Time will tell whether these threats from Democrats will be taken seriously by either party or anything will come of them.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Kristi Noem is a liar, she&#39;s vicious. She&#39;s also incompetent. Donald Trump must fire her at once before another American is killed under her watch.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Donny 2-Dolls thinks he&#39;s a brilliant businessman, but his lifelong habit of destroying the businesses he runs shows us otherwise. And his string of failed businesses continues even during his second term as president.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Last year, Trump took over control of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C. and renamed it to the &quot;The Donald Trump and the John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts.&quot; The name itself is laughable due to the grammatical errors in the new name (It should read &quot;The Donald Trump and John F. Kennedy...&quot;) and the fact that the term &quot;memorial&quot; should only be used when the namesake is deceased.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What&#39;s even more laughable is the utter failure Donny 2-Dolls has made of the Center. Once a world-class venue for the performing arts, under Trump&#39;s leadership, the Kennedy Center has seen the lowest ticket sales in years, and a wave a cancellations of scheduled events. Under Trump&#39;s business leadership, the Kennedy Center can no longer remain in operation, and will close its doors for &quot;approximately&quot; two years.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Trump is claiming that the closure is to &quot;renovate&quot; the facility, but the timing is certainly questionable. Under this plan, the center will be closed until some time in 2028, and we can pretty well assume that it will remain closed until after the 2028 elections. Whether or not it reopens will no doubt depend on who wins that election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The ugly...&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blob&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-title&quot;&gt;
        Trump announces plans for the federal government to take control of elections &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ms.now/news/trump-suggests-federal-control-of-elections-in-some-areas&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-content&quot;&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Donny 2-Dolls has been floating the idea of having Republicans &quot;take over&quot; election administration in &quot;some areas&quot; of the country.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Constitution is very clear that elections are to be held by states without federal interference. Because of this, the president&#39;s announcements should raise alarm for anyone who believes in the rule of law and the validity of the Constitution of the Untied States of America.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Trump is claiming, without evidence (as always), that elections are &quot;unbelievably corrupt&quot; in &quot;some areas.&quot; There is no credible evidence of widespread fraud in this country&#39;s elections, and these claims are nothing more than blatant lies. FBI agents raided the Fulton County elections office in Georgia last week and took possession of official voter records from 2020, and will soon be making additional false claims that they have &quot;discovered&quot; fraud in these records, and will use this falsified evidence to claim that election fraud is a credible threat and that they have to nationalize the elections in order to ensure that their party &quot;wins&quot; the 2026 midterms.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;One thing is absolutely clear: The threats to our elections are indications that the Trump regime knows that they will lose representatives in Congress in the 2026 mid-term elections, and they are going everything in their power to try to prevent a free and fair election this year. The video below is from the weekly &lt;i&gt;What&#39;s the Plan&lt;/i&gt; discussion hosted by &lt;i&gt;Indivisible&lt;/i&gt; co-executive directors Leah Greenberg and Ezra Levin. It&#39;s an hour-long video, but if you don&#39;t have time to watch the whole thing, watch the video from where it starts (5:03) until 8:53. Leah summarizes the regime&#39;s strategy and outlines how we can best fight against it.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;For the past year, Trump has been using tariffs and the threats of tariffs to manipulate the economy of the United States. One day, he&#39;s threatening massive tariffs, and the next day he&#39;s delaying or dropping those tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While we all know that Donny 2-Dolls is a fool, these actions are not just the result of his incompetence, but they are part of a larger strategy from his handlers to control the United States economy to benefit the current regime and its sycophants.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Trump uses the threats of tariffs to turn his power into personal profits. He threatens to impose tariffs on foreign goods, which threatens the profits of foreign companies. They respond by making large contributions to Trump&#39;s campaign or investing in his various grifts. If their bribe is considered acceptable, Trump will make an exception to the tariffs for those companies. Trump ends up making more money, the companies that bribe him have a competitive advantage over their rivals, and the American people are left to pay the price.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Nationwide protests erupt over the brutal slayings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good by ICE agents in Minneapolis as violence against civilians continues to escalate. On Friday, Americans around the country took to the streets again to protest the Trump regime&#39;s fascist takeover of this country. Schools and businesses in several states have closed in a grass-roots general strike intended to shut down the economy.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;These protests have been organized primarily in response to ICE violence in Minnesota, but across the country, dissatisfaction with the Trump regime&#39;s policies continues to grow. Another &quot;No Kings&quot; protest is planned for Saturday, March 28. The last &quot;No Kings&quot; protest was the largest single day of protest in the history of the United States, and it is expected that the protest on March 28 will be even larger.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For many people, these protests feel like they are not working as the Trump regime continues to abuse its power and further demolish our democratic institutions and deny us our constitutional rights. But it&#39;s vitally important that we keep up the momentum and continue to organize and let the world know that we do not accept the current state of affairs. This is not the United States of America that any of us want to live in. So we must stay the course. Stay angry, stay loud, and make your voice heard at every opportunity. We&#39;re all afraid, we&#39;re all tired, and we&#39;re all feeling a bit hopeless. And that&#39;s exactly what the regime wants. They want to wear us down, to make us feel like nothing will ever change. They want us to accept what they are doing as the new normal. No matter what happens, we can never allow our opposition to be silenced. Find a protest, find a group, take a stand, and let the world know that you stand for liberty and justice for all.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Trump regime has arrested four independent journalists after they covered an anti-ICE protest in Minnesota: Don Lemon, Trahern Jeen Crews, Georgia Fort, and Jamael Lydell Lundy. These arrests were made despite the fact that multiple judges refused to approve the baseless arrest warrants. These reporters were exercising their right to report on matters of public interest, which is a fundamental pillar of a free press. The arrests are a clear indication that the Trump regime is attempting to intimidate and silence journalists who are doing their jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Civil rights activists are outraged by this blatant attempt to silence the press. Reverend Al Sharpton accused the Trump regime of taking a &quot;sledge hammer [to] the knees of the First Amendment.&quot; Lemon and Fort are both independent journalists, Crews is the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Minnesota and former candidate for mayor and state representative, and Lundy is a candidate for Minnesota Senate District 65.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The journalists were covering a peaceful protest at Cities Church in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Demonstrators disrupted a church service earlier this month because one of the staff members is a field office director for ICE. Protesters were there to point out the hypocrisy of a church that claims to follow the teachings of Jesus, the Prince of Peace, while openly supporting the ever-increasing violence of ICE in particular and the Trump regime in general.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;As journalists, our first obligation is to bear witness and to inform. When those obligations are met with detention or prosecution instead of protection, we must ask: &#39;What message are we sending about who gets to report and who gets silenced?&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;FBI agents carted off pallets of official 2020 voter records from Fulton County, Georgia. The seizure was ordered by the Trump regime based on Donny 2-Dolls&#39; repeatedly-disproven claims that he won the 2020 presidential election. Fulton County officials have expressed deep concern about the FBI&#39;s seizure. The records are the original voter records from the election that have been protected by Fulton County since 2020. Now that they have been seized by agents of the federal government, there is no longer a public chain of custody. Nobody knows where the records are being taken or who is protecting them. Now that the chain of custody has been broken, any &quot;conclusions&quot; that can be drawn from these ballots is unreliable at best because there is no way to prove that these records have not been tampered with.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The results of the 2020 election have been held up repeatedly throughout multiple investigations, and there is absolutely no sign of any wrongdoing&amp;mdash;with one exception: Donny 2-Dolls called election officials in Fulton County after he lost the election and asked them to &quot;find&quot; him enough votes to overturn the results of the election and threatened to press charges against Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger if he refused to comply.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The simple fact is that Trump lost the 2020 election fair and square. And even if he feels like he should have won, it&#39;s completely irrelevant because he is currently the President of the United States of America. So even if his outrageous lies could be shown to be true, it would not do or change anything in the world&amp;mdash;he&#39;d still be the president. So what&#39;s the point?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The point is that the Trump regime is setting the stage to either rig, undermine, or eliminate the 2026 mid-term elections. The first year of his second term in office has been an unmitigated disaster from the very beginning. His approval ratings are abysmal, his own base is starting to question his actions, his mental health is rapidly deteriorating, and he is afraid. There is little doubt that if the Republicans lose their majority in Congress, Trump will be impeached and there is actually a slim chance he will be removed from office. He&#39;s doing everything he can to prevent that from happening.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with Fulton? Now that the Trump regime has captured the voter records from 2020, they will alter the results, claim that the election was, indeed, rigged or stolen, and then claim that the fraud was perpetrated through mail-in ballots. He will then try to prevent states from allowing mail-in ballots in the 2026 elections. This will make it harder for many voters to cast their vote, and history seems to indicate that elections with lower voter turnouts tend to favor the Republican Party.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Just 11 weeks after the end of the last government shutdown, the US government is once again shut down. This shutdown is technically only a partial shutdown because Senators approved a funding bill to approve funding for most government departments through September, but only provides 2 weeks of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, which provides funding for ICE. The Senate bill still has to be approved by the House of Representatives, which was not in session last week and is likely to vote on the bill early next week.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The bill approves continued funding for DHS for 2 weeks to give Congress a chance to come to an agreement on future funding for ICE. Despite the public demands to abolish ICE completely, Democrats are only asking for promises of new rules and the requirement of oversight and judicial warrants for ICE activities. They want ICE agents to operate without masks, wear and use body cameras, and wear visible identification.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This shutdown does not affect food assistance programs or the VA, which have already been funded through the end of the fiscal year in September. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The bad...&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blob&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-title&quot;&gt;
        More than a month after the deadline to release the Epstein Files has passed and less than 1% have been released &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/24/legal-experts-epstein-files-release-congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On November 19,  Congress passed a law called the &quot;Epstein Files Transparency Act&quot; that ordered the Attorney General to &quot;make publicly available in a searchable and downloadable format all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in the possession of the Department of Justice&quot; that relate to Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days. That deadline came and went on December 19th. This week marked the passage of a full month since that deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;So, has the Trump regime obeyed the law passed by Congress and signed by Donny 2-Dolls?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;No. Less than 1% of the files have been released to date, and the few files that were released since the passage of the law are mostly documents that have already been released to the public previously. Despite going to war with Venezuela, threatening to take Greenland by force from our own NATO ally, and sending thousands of armed thugs into Democratic cities to terrorize and murder United States citizens right here at home, the Trump regime just can&#39;t seem to make people forget about the Epstein Files.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This is a major issue for the Trump regime because Donny 2-Dolls ran on campaign promises to release the Epstein Files, and some of his sycophants have become slightly less ardent in their support of the Trump regime as he&#39;s continually refused to keep that promise.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;What can be done to force the Trump regime to obey the laws it has passed? There&#39;s not much that can make an immediate difference, but steady and ongoing legal pressure to force the regime to provide legal justification for its refusal to comply with the law and ongoing public pressure can eventually force the regime&#39;s hand. But it won&#39;t happen any time soon, and it won&#39;t be easy.&lt;/p&gt;

        ICE-stapo continues its murderous rampage &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-minnesota-4d1499fc5962ab880f3816259e04bdbf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;ICE-stapo agents gunned down another man on the streets of Minnesota on Saturday. Details are sketchy at the time of this writing, but video shows agents wrestling a man to the ground, repeatedly striking him on the head, and then shooting him dead. The man has been identified as Alex Jeffrey Pretti, an ICU nurse at a Minneapolis VA hospital. As with the killing of Renee Good, federal agents and the Department of Homeland Security have blatantly lied about the events, despite the fact that both shootings were captured on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The killing is part of the largest immigration enforcement operation in the history of this country, but had nothing to do with immigration enforcement at all. Federal agents were not engaged in any specific immigration enforcement operations at the time, but were swarming the streets to square off against protesters in the hopes of instilling fear into the local community. This is a terrorist tactic aimed at intimidating people into accepting the Trump regime&#39;s refusal to follow the law or respect the Constitution.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;There is no place in this country for an organization like ICE, and there is no place in this country for the authoritarian Trump regime.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Immigration agents are being instructed by Trump officials to violate the constitution. The Fourth Amendment provides protections against unreasonable search and seizures. But ICE agents have been told those constitutional constraints do not apply. A whistleblower revealed a secret ICE memo saying they do not need a judicial warrant to forcibly break into a home.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img class=&quot;img-lightbox&quot; alt=&quot;Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a &#39;right of ownership&#39; anyway? There are no written documents, it&#39;s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; style=&quot;--img-width:200&quot; src=&quot;/images/JsI76sSkU2-200.webp&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;887&quot; srcset=&quot;/images/JsI76sSkU2-200.webp 200w, /images/JsI76sSkU2-800.webp 800w&quot; sizes=&quot;200px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Donny 2-Dolls has never been smart. His rambling, incoherent rants have become so common in his two terms as President that nobody really talks about them anymore. While his messages continue to reflect his stupidity, recent messages also point to something far worse. The president of the United States is in very serious (and obvious) cognitive decline. In one of his recent ramblings, he sent a letter to the Prime Minister of Norway threatening to take Greenland (A territory of Denmark) by military force because he wasn&#39;t awarded the Nobel Peace Prize (which is not awarded by the Norwegian government anyway, but by an independent committee).&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Ty Cobb, a former White House lawyer in Trump&#39;s first term, recently commented, &quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anybody outside of the United States who believes that Trump is sane.&quot; Cobb pointed out that Trump&#39;s signs of dementia and cognitive decline are &quot;palpable.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This has led many people to call for the invocation of the &lt;a href=&quot;/charters-of-freedom/constitution/#Amd25S4&quot;&gt;25th Amendment&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the vice president to assume the powers and duties of the president if the president is unable to discharge the duties of the office. Since J.D. Vance is nothing more than a Trump regime bootlicker, it&#39;s unlikely that any of the disasters Donny 2-Dolls has brought down on this country would be averted, but at the very least, we would no longer be led by a mentally unstable narcissist.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Dear Jonas: Considering your Country decided not to give me the Nobel Peace Prize for having stopped 8 wars PLUS, I no longer feel an obligation to think purely of Peace, although it will always be predominant, but can now think about what is good and proper for the United States of America. Denmark cannot protect that land from Russia or China, and why do they have a &#39;right of ownership&#39; anyway? There are no written documents, it&#39;s only that a boat landed there hundreds of years ago, but we had boats landing there, also. I have done more for NATO than any other person since its founding, and now, NATO should do something for the United States. The World is not secure unless we have Complete and Total Control of Greenland. Thank you! President DJT&lt;/p&gt;

        Judge blocks ICE-stapo in Minnesota from arresting or using crowd control tools against peaceful protesters  &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2026/01/trump-minnesota-federal-ruling-walz-frey/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;A federal agent crosses the street in order to get close enough to spray protesters on the other side with pepper spray on January 10 in Minneapolis&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A Minnesota judge has issued an order prohibiting federal agents from &quot;using pepper-spray or similar nonlethal munitions and crowd dispersal tools against persons who are engaging in peaceful and unobstructive protest activity.&quot; The order also bars federal agents from stopping vehicles from following them as long as those vehicles maintain a safe distance.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The ruling is likely to be overturned by Trump regime sycophants in the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, but it is important that rulings like this continue. Even if it doesn&#39;t change things (at least not immediately), we all have to continue to protest, to legally challenge the regime&#39;s unconstitutional behavior, and to make it clear that the policies of the regime are not supported by the people of the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;The bad...&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blob&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-title&quot;&gt;
        The Trump regime&#39;s plan to dismantle public education &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NYq_N6fO-w&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-content&quot;&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;By now, we all know that the Trump regime is planning on closing the Department of Education. But before they do that, they plan to use the power of that department to fundamentally change the very nature of public education.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Department of Education was created to enforce civil rights and ensure all children, regardless of race, religion, or economic background had access to a quality education. And that&#39;s precisely what the Trump regime opposes. The regime is actively trying to push towards private schooling. This may sound, at first, like giving parents more choices in their child&#39;s education, but will inevitably lead to massive fraud and wholesale discrimination since there will be no authority to regulate these private schools&#39; tuition charges, enrollment decisions, or curriculum standards.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the Trump regime is pushing for our public schools to push their corrupted version of &quot;Christian&quot; values on all students, regardless of their religious background or their parents&#39; rights to train their own children in their chosen religion.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;As children leave the public school system, either because their parents prefer private schools or because public schools do not offer a quality education to their particular race or gender or religion, the amount of money available for public schools (from federal or state sources) will decrease, leading to a predictable and inevitable collapse of the entire public school system.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime spent nearly $30 billion of taxpayer money to beef up its ICE-stapo goon squad in 2025. They have doubled the number of goons in the squad in the past year, engaging in massive hiring campaigns in every state.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Laura Jedeed, a freelance journalist wrote about her experience applying for a job with ICE. To be clear: She had no intention of ever working for ICE, she just wanted to know what the hiring process looked like.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;An Army veteran deployed to Afghanistan twice, Jedeed definitely fit the ICE-stapo&#39;s target recruiting demographic. But she also has a strong internet presence, and her views opposing ICE and the Trump regime are plastered all over the internet. That should have been an immediate red flag, but she was eventually offered a job anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Jedeed shares her experience attending the nearly-empty recruiting expo in Dallas and the horrifically sloppy recruiting process. She also shares her surprise that she was offered a job, pending the completion of paperwork, and further surprise that she was still offered the job despite the fact that she did not submit the required paperwork. And even more surprise when she was later listed as &quot;Entered on Duty&quot; despite the fact that she never accepted the job at all.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;If they missed the fact that I was an anti-ICE journalist who didn&#39;t fill out her paperwork, what else might they be missing? How many convicted domestic abusers are being given guns and sent into other people&#39;s homes? How many people with ties to white supremacist organizations are indiscriminately targeting minorities on principle, regardless of immigration status? How many rapists and pedophiles are working in ICE detention centers with direct and unsupervised access to a population that will be neither believed nor missed? How are we to trust ICE&#39;s allegedly thorough investigations of the people they detain and deport when they can&#39;t even keep their HR paperwork straight?&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;And if they&#39;re not going to screen me out, what hope is there of figuring out which recruit might one day turn into a trigger-happy agent who would forget that law enforcement officers are trained not to stand in front of vehicles, get jumpy, and shoot a 37-year-old woman to death on the streets of Minneapolis?&lt;/p&gt;

        Did anything good happen in 2025? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp26en-qCNg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no doubt that 2025 will go down as one of the worst years in the history of the United States of America. After 249 years of democracy, we now live in a fascist state run by a dictator who has no regard for the Constitution or the rule of law. Once the most powerful nation in the world, we have become a weak and untrustworthy nation, and pose a distinct threat to global peace and prosperity.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;But believe it or not, there are some things that happened in 2025 that are worth celebrating. It&#39;s not enough to overcome the bad news, but we will never be able to fix the mess we&#39;ve made of our country if we don&#39;t recognize and celebrate the small victories along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;figcaption class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;Senator Mark Kelly, Captain, United States Navy, retired&lt;/figcaption&gt;
            &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth is demoting retired Navy Captain and NASA astronaut Mark Kelly to take away the senator&#39;s retirement income. Why? Because Kelly had the audacity to remind service members that the Uniform Code of Military Justice requires that military members of any rank have both the right and the responsibility to refuse to follow illegal orders. Kelly has broken no laws, nor had he behaved in a way that justifies such a demotion. This action is nothing more than the Trump regime weaponizing the government against its own political enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Since Kelly is the only one of the six MOCs appearing in the video who retired from military service, he is the only one who can be punished in this way. The demotion will reduce Kelly&#39;s retirement pay by about $1,000 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;My rank and retirement are things that I earned through my service and sacrifice for this country. I got shot at. I missed holidays and birthdays. I commanded a space shuttle mission while my wife [former Representative Gabby Giffords] recovered from a gunshot wound to the head—all while proudly wearing the American flag on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;If Pete Hegseth, the most unqualified Secretary of Defense in our country&#39;s history, thinks he can intimidate me with a censure or threats to demote me or prosecute me, he still doesn&#39;t get it.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Trump regime is withholding $10 billion in child care, food assistance, and child welfare funds from 5 Democratic-led states: California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York. The programs being cut provide day care subsidies and other financial support to some of the nation&#39;s neediest residents.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The administration claims these funds are being withheld due to fraud concerns, but critics argue that this is a politically motivated move to target and undermine Democratic-led states. If there are legitimate concerns about fraud, cutting funding to the needy is not the way to address it. Imagine if someone identified fraud in the Social Security program and responded by simply stopping payments to retired Americans. While that might eliminate the fraud, it would also cause immense suffering to those who depend on these programs. The same holds true for this shameful move by the Trump regime.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For decades, the Republican Party has claimed to be the party of family values, but actions like these show just how hypocritical the Party actually is. New York Senator Kristen Gillibrand put it this way: &quot;To use the power of the government to harm the neediest Americans is immoral and indefensible.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, January 7, ICE-stapo agent Jonathan Ross murdered Renee Good in Minnesota. Good was driving an SUV, which she stopped in the middle of the road, blocking the path of an ICE vehicle. Jonathan Ross exits the ICE vehicle and circles around Good&#39;s SUV, where he is confronted by Good&#39;s wife, Becca, who was outside of the vehicle. Meanwhile, two other agents exit their vehicle and attempt to open Good&#39;s door. Good backs the vehicle away from the agents and then attempts to drive forward to flee the scene. Her vehicle is moving away from the three agents when Ross draws his gun and fires three times at Good as she attempts to drive away.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime has labeled Good as a domestic terrorist and accused Good of attacking federal agents. But the entire incident was recorded by multiple bystanders and by Ross himself, and the videos clearly shows that the agents were under no threat from Good. The murder was an act of sheer cowardice by Jonathan Ross.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On New Year&#39;s Eve, Keith Porter was murdered by an unnamed off-duty ICE-stapo agent in California. Porter was allegedly ringing in the new year by firing shots from a rifle into the air (Which is illegal because it is extremely dangerous). One of the building&#39;s residents was and ICE agent who, upon hearing the gunshots grabbed his own gun and confronted Porter. The agent ended up killing Porter.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Unlike the murder of Good, Porter&#39;s death was not caught on camera. The Trump regime has claimed that Porter fired on the off-duty agent, but Porter&#39;s friends and family find that hard to believe. According to the family&#39;s attorney, &quot;What should have been and arrest and possible citation has turned into a death sentence and potentially cold-blooded murder from and ICE agent who was not equipped to handle the situation.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        Actions in Venezuela: Invasion, law enforcement, or extortion? &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.govtrack.us/posts/564/2026-01-08_venezuela-and-congress&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;/a&gt;
    
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the past few months, the United States has bombed small boats crewed by Venezuelan civilians, enacted military blockades around Venezuelan ports, bombed the capital city of Venezuela, abducted the sitting president of Venezuela, and announced plans to seize Venezuela&#39;s oil and other natural resources indefinitely. What does this all mean? Is it legal? Was it an invasion, a law enforcement action, and act of extortion? Are we at war with Venezuela?&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While the United States has not actually declared war on Venezuela, we are engaging in war-like behavior. While the president has some powers to authorize military action without declaring war, the Constitution limits that power to ensure that Congress is involved in any such decisions. To date, Congress has not authorized any such military action.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States is a member of the United Nations and, as such, is bound by international law as defined by the United Nations. Under UN treaty, &quot;All members shall refrain...from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State.&quot; The actions of the United States clearly violate these terms. The Trump regime claims that this was a law enforcement action conducted to arrest a wanted criminal, but no country has the legal authority to arrest a foreign national living in another country without the consent of that country&#39;s government. These provisions are essential to the peace and stability of the whole world, and the blatant violation of these principles by the United States makes our country a clear and present danger to the international community.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;So, what will Congress do about it? Exactly what they always do: &quot;piss and moan like an impotent jerk and then bend over and take it up the tailpipe.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        Trump regime gives up its attempts to keep control of the National Guard in LA, Portland, and Chicago &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-12-31/trump-administration-retreats-in-newsom-lawsuit-over-national-guard-deployment&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Trump regime has been unable to come up with a compelling legal justification for deploying National Guard troops in California, Oregon, and Illinois. After 6 months of failed legal battles, the regime has finally given up its attempts to appeal court rulings ordering the removal of troops, effectively returning control of the National Guard to state leaders...where it has always belonged.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;For six months, California National Guard troops have been used as political pawns by a President desperate to be king.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;From the political display in MacArthur Park to their unlawful participation in indiscriminate immigration raids, the militaristic deployment of National Guard troops to Los Angeles streets has left lasting scars in Angeleno communities. There is a reason our founders decided military and civilian affairs must be kept separate; a reason that our military is, by design, apolitical.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Jack Smith testified to Congress that Donald Trump was responsible for the January 6 Capitol riot, and defended efforts to hold him accountable. The deposition and official transcript have both been released to the public and are available online.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Smith led a 2023 investigation into Trump&#39;s role in the events of January 6, 2021, and his retention of classified documents in his private residence after leaving office in 2021. He dropped the investigation after Trump&#39;s election as president in 2024 because the Justice Department does not allow indictments of a sitting president. But Smith testified that his investigation had gathered proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that Trump had &quot;engaged in a criminal scheme&quot; to overturn the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Florida Governor Ron DeSantis&#39; administration spent over $35 million in taxpayer funds that were allocated for child welfare and medical services for political consulting and advertising campaigns to oppose ballot initiatives he opposed.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While the governor is entitled to his own political opinions, the use of public funds previously allocated to other purposes is a misuse of taxpayer funds and violates the principle of accountability in government. &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Professor emeritus Kenneth Goodman, former director of medical ethics at the University of Miami declared the spending of child welfare funds on &quot;undermining the will of the voters&quot; amounts to &quot;corruption at the expense of children.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Trump regime has escalated its undeclared war on Venezuela by capturing the president and declaring that the United States will govern Venezuela until there&#39;s a &quot;proper transition.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There is no legal, moral, or constitutional justification for this action. It is an outrageous act of war taken against a sovereign nation in a pathetic attempt to assume control of Venezuela&#39;s vast oil reserves. The Trump regime is trying to cover our country&#39;s failing economy, domestic turmoil, and its own plummeting approval ratings by launching a war against a made-up enemy to distract the media and the public.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The United States has become a threat to the world&#39;s stability and peace. While the country has a long history of imperialistic actions, it has never before been so blatant in flaunting domestic and international law and abusing its power.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;I am a patriot and a veteran of the United States military, and I have never been ashamed to be an American...until now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: Abughazaleh turns campaign office into aid hub. Trump regime desecrates Christmas. CBS pulls CECOT report hours before scheduled broadcast. Trump regime makes a habit of breaking the law.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Political candidates in the United States have to raise sickening amounts of money just to run for office. Nearly $16 billion was spent on the 2024 election. That kind of spending should make us all sick.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It certainly made congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh sick. So she decided to do things differently in her campaign. Her campaign headquarters in Chicago&#39;s North Side has become a mutual aid hub filled with basic necessities like diapers, winter clothes, medical supplies, tampons, food, and more. Why? To show her constituents the value of her campaign rather than just spending money on advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I wanted to figure out the best way to use our funds to not just run a race, but also help the community, because if every campaign did something like that, then every election would be a net benefit to the community, win or lose.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figcaption class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;Kat Abughazaleh, Congressional Candidate for Illinois&#39; 5th District&lt;/figcaption&gt;
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Her campaign is gaining traction with the people of Chicago, especially since she&#39;s taken a strong stand against the ICE-stapo invasion. But it&#39;s also getting attention from the Trump regime, which is turning the Department of Justice against her. Abughazaleh has been indicted on federal conspiracy charges for protesting inhumane treatment at an ICE facility.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On Christmas day, Donny 2-Dolls ordered the United States military to bomb alleged ISIS camps in Sokoto State, Nigeria. While these strikes were conducted in cooperation with Nigeria&#39;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nigerians&amp;mdash;including President Bola Tinubu&amp;mdash;have expressed frustration with Trump&#39;s designation of their country as &quot;disgraced&quot; and a &quot;country of particular concern.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime is claiming that these strikes were carried out in retaliating for the killing of Christians in what he calls a violation of religious freedom. As always, the regime&#39;s story is not consistent with the truth. While Nigeria has been plagued by ongoing conflicts and armed insurgent groups operating in the nation, residents and experts report that the killings that take place are not targeting people based on religious beliefs. The population of Nigeria is mostly split between Christians and Muslims, and terrorist violence within the country threatens both faith groups.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The core message of the Christmas holiday in Christian traditions is, &quot;Peace on Earth, good will to men.&quot; This action by the United States&amp;mdash;and the timing&amp;mdash;is a disgrace to our nation and an affront to actual Christians, wherever they happen to live.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Shortly before the scheduled broadcast of an investigation into the El Salvador prison CECOT, NBC news editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, changed the schedule to bump the program to a &quot;future broadcast.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;CBS News is owned by Paramount Skydance, which just happens to be in a bidding war to acquire Warner Bros Discovery, and needs approval from the FCC for the merger. Weiss claims she pulled the piece because it &quot;wasn&#39;t ready.&quot; She claimed it needed to include an interview with the violently anti-immigrant Deputy Chief of Staff, Stephen Miller.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The reality is that the piece was already screened multiple times, cleared by CBS for airing, scheduled for broadcast, and advertised for days on social media. Pulling the content just hours before broadcast can only mean Weiss was being pressured by the Trump regime to stop the report from airing. The chance that the piece will be aired in a &quot;future broadcast&quot; is highly unlikely unless it can be skewed enough to paint the Trump regime in a favorable light.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;One thing that the Trump regime has made absolutely clear is its complete disdain for the rule of law. Any laws that don&#39;t happen to align with the regime&#39;s twisted goals are simply ignored, even while it tries to weaponize its own laws against political enemies. And the regime is not shy about it, either, loudly proclaiming its disdain for the law at every opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;I don&#39;t want President Trump having to lose a moment of time having fights in the Oval Office about whether something is legal or doable or moral.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;From trivial matters to serious constitutional violations, the Trump regime has shown a consistent pattern of disregarding the law. Whether it is changing the name of the Kennedy Center and the Department of Justice without the legal authority to do so or killing sailors clinging to the wreckage of their vessel in the middle of the ocean in blatant violation of U.S. and international law, the regime proudly displays its evil intentions for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The simple fact of the matter is: If you&#39;re not seeing it, you&#39;re complicit in it.&lt;/p&gt;

Dismissed court cases being reopened, bringing new deportation threats to lowest-risk immigrants. Zohran Mamdani demonstrates how we can celebrate our differences with joy and respect.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Jack Smith, former special counsel for the Justice Department was interviewed this week by the House Judiciary Committee. In the interview, Smith announced he had proof &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that Donny 2-Dolls criminally conspired to overturn the 2020 election results. In other words, Trump knew the election was not stolen and that his efforts to reverse the outcome were criminal even while he carried them out.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;While most of the discussion centered around efforts to overthrow the election, Smith also discussed &quot;powerful evidence&quot; that Trump&#39;s storing of classified documents in his Florida residence was a deliberate obstruction of justice.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Smith has been under immense pressure from the unprecedented retribution campaign the Trump regime has mounted to (unsuccessfully) silence him.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime has infuriated Republicans and Democrats alike by releasing only a portion of the Epstein files by the December 19 deadline. Federal law requires that all files had to be released by this date.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In addition to withholding a majority of the files that they were obligated to release this week, the Trump regime has also heavily redacted the portion they have released so far.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime has found a new population to terrorize with threats of deportation by requesting to reopen more than 117,000 immigration cases that were dismissed to signal there is no need to deport the immigrants involved because the individuals posed no threat, meaning the cases were not worth the court&#39;s time to pursue.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Some of the cases being re-opened involve immigrants who have since been moved to a legal resident status. Others have passed away, and still others have moved and cannot be located at their previous addresses. More importantly, re-opening these low-priority cases against immigrants who pose no tangible threat to national security or their local communities is a waste of the court&#39;s time and resources and the taxpayers&#39; money.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;At a time when adherents to Christian Nationalism&amp;mdash;an extremist, aggressive, and violent perversion of the Christian faith&amp;mdash;are using their political, social, and religious privilege to oppress and condemn anyone they label as &quot;different,&quot; everyone should watch the video below.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Zohran Mamdani is the mayor-elect of New York City, and will become the first Muslim mayor in the city&#39;s history when he assumes the office on January 1. Here, we see him celebrating Hanukkah with a Jewish family. These are genuine smiles and laughter, and everyone we see is filled with joy and treating one another with love and respect.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The entire video offers a stark contrast to the division and hatred we have seen so often this year in the news and in our social media feeds. This is just a glimpse of what the United States of America can and should be.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;More of this, please, from all of us.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Salaam, shalom, and happy Hanukkah!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: Kilmar Abrego Garcia free again. Trump regime&amp;#39;s exposes its own hypocrisy. U.S. citizenship on sale now and U.S. military seizes Venezuelan oil tanker. Beware of surveillance pricing when shopping online.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h4&gt;The good...&lt;/h4&gt;
	&lt;div class=&quot;blob&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-title&quot;&gt;
        Kilmar Abrego Garcia freed from immigration detention &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/abrego-garcia-el-salvador-deportation-31160936c51932f74b717eb1143edd55&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Kilmar Abrego Garcia, from his meeting with Senator Chris Van Hollen on April 17, 2025, in El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On March 12, Kilmar Abrego Garcia was arrested by a DHS agent. Three days later, he was sent to a torture prison in El Salvador despite a court order specifically prohibiting his deportation to El Salvador. Despite the fact that he was &quot;accidentally&quot; deported, the Trump regime refused to bring him back to his home in the United States and falsely claimed that he was a member of a terrorist organization. The Supreme Court ordered the regime to effectuate Abrego Garcia&#39;s return. The Trump regime still refused to take action to bring Abrego Garcia home. They fought against the ruling, but after months of failed arguments and unaccepted excuses, they did arrange to bring Abrego Garcia back to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;But the persecution didn&#39;t stop there. The Trump regime doubled-down on their false allegations that Abrego Garcia was a member of a terrorist organization and when he was returned to the United States, it was to face criminal charges. He remained in prison for several months before being returned to his home state of Maryland. Three days later, he was detained again at a routine check-in, and has been imprisoned since then while the Trump regime has repeatedly threatened to deport him to any country other than El Salvador.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This week, Abrego Garcia&#39;s habeas petition was granted and a federal judge ordered his release from custody. But Kilmar Abrego Garcia is one of the most blatant examples of the Trump regime&#39;s incompetence and cruelty, so there is no doubt that they will try again to find some excuse to continue his persecution.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-title&quot;&gt;
        The hypocrisy of the Trump regime would be laughable if it weren&#39;t so embarrassing &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-mortgage-fraud-florida-principal-residences&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Donny 2-Dolls has accused several of his political enemies of mortgage fraud for listing more than one primary residence on their mortgage applications. He called the act &quot;crooked,&quot; and &quot;deceitful and potentially criminal.&quot; But Trump&#39;s use of this accusation to attempt to bully his political enemies only exposes his own hypocrisy: He has committed this same crime himself, buying multiple properties and claiming them each as primary residences simultaneously, even though he was working with leasing companies to rent out the properties as soon as the purchases were complete.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Given Trump’s position on situations like this, he’s going to either need to fire himself or refer himself to the Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Trump has deemed that this type of misrepresentation is sufficient to preclude someone from serving the country.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;figcaption class=&quot;blockquote-footer&quot;&gt;Kathleen Engel, Suffolk University Law Professor and Mortgage Finance Expert&lt;/figcaption&gt;
		&lt;/blockquote&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has exposed his own hypocrisy in a similar way. In 2015, then a representative from Wisconsin, wrote a lengthy legal brief in which he articulated a strong and compelling argument defending the role of Congress as a check on the president, arguing, &quot;[Congress] may not bestow upon the Executive its own exclusive power of the purse,&quot; and that among the founders of the nation there was &quot;unanimous agreement that Congress, not the President, should control the purse.&quot; These words directly oppose Duffy&#39;s actions in his current role. Rather than respecting Congress&#39; power of the purse, he is attempting to restrict congressionally-appropriated transportation funding. The Government Accountability Office has already concluded that Duffy&#39;s Department of Transportation had broken the law by halting payments for electric car charging stations Congress had already approved. Duffy is now trying to put conditions on state funding for transportation infrastructure based on the state&#39;s willingness to help persecute immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;These are just some examples of the blatant hypocrisy demonstrated daily by the Trump regime. While it is highly unlikely that any of these actions will be punished, it is important to continually bring them to light to remind us of why these people have no right to hold positions of leadership or authority within our country. In the same way and for the same reasons that our founders &lt;a href=&quot;https://free-the-people.us/charters-of-freedom/declaration-of-independence/&quot;&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; that King George III had no legal authority to rule the American colonies, we &lt;a href=&quot;https://free-the-people.us/about/resolution/&quot;&gt;declare&lt;/a&gt; that the Trump regime has no legal authority to rule the United States of America.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While the Trump regime is actively engaged in rounding up and deporting hard-working immigrants and imposing ridiculous requirements on tourists entering the country, they are also making it clear that this level of persecution only applies to the poor. If you&#39;re rich enough, you can literally buy a golden ticket to gain access to everything the United States has to offer. The ticket entitles its owner to permanent legal residency in the United States and a streamlined path to citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donny 2-Dolls said the program will result in &quot;somebody great coming into our country because we think these will be some tremendous people.&quot; This tells you everything you need to know about our current Idiot in Chief. According to him, having money automatically makes a person &quot;tremendous,&quot; while poor people are expendable at best, and a nuisance to be eradicated at worst.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When the idea was first released back in March, the Trump regime priced the cards at $5 million and estimated they would sell hundreds of thousands of the cards, raking in at least a trillion dollars. They&#39;ve lowered the price to a paltry $1 million, but are still expecting to earn billions of dollars from the program. And what do they plan to do with all this money they are going to be raking in? Donny 2-Dolls says the payments for these golden tickets will &quot;go to the U.S. government...where we can do things positive for the country.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The United States has seized a commercial oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, and armed members of the Coast Guard boarded and took control of the ship by fast-roping off of helicopters hovering just off the deck of the ship.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Taking over a merchant ship outside our own coastal waters is unusual, and a violation of international law. The Trump regime is claiming the oil tanker is &quot;involved in an illicit oil shipping network supporting foreign terrorist organizations.&quot; As usual, they are not offering any evidence of their claims. The excuse is wearing a bit thin, as the regime has been labeling everything it opposes as terrorism. Immigrants residing in our country (legally or not) are being labeled terrorists. That was the case with Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported and imprisoned due to a clerical error before the regime retroactively claimed, without evidence, he belonged to a terrorist organization. Venezuelan boats have been bombed in international waters, killing dozens of people who the regime is claiming, also without evidence, belong to narco-terrorist groups (Whatever that means). Now commercial oil tankers are being seized by our military using the same flimsy claims.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The truth is, none of this has anything to do with terrorism or drug trafficking or defending the United States from imaginary threats. It is all about Trump&#39;s plan to overthrow Venezuelan president, Nicolás Maduro. Not because Maduro may have stolen the election in 2024, or because he is acting as a dictator, but because many of the Venezuelans whe have fled the country&#39;s political and economic situation have sought asylum (legally) in the United States. And let&#39;s not forget that Venezuela has the world&#39;s largest oil reserves, and the United States has a long history of fighting wars to control the international flow of oil. Trump has even stated that there is likely to be a ground invasion of Venezuela starting soon, though there is no reasonable legal justification for such an invasion of a sovereign nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: ADM Holsey retires early amid tension over Caribbean strikes and Costco sues Trump regime for tariff refund. Reports of DOGE&amp;#39;s death exaggerated. Double-tap on Venezuelan drug boat is a war crime.&lt;/p&gt;

        Admiral Holsey set to retire early amid tension over Caribbean strikes &lt;a href=&quot;https://allaboutlawyer.com/admiral-alvin-holsey-retires-friday-after-clash-with-hegseth-over-venezuela-strikes/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On December 12, Admiral Alvin Holsey will become the latest top-ranking military official to step down or be replaced since the Trump regime took power. His retirement, which was announced in October, coincides with the growing recognition that U.S. attacks on Venezuela are most likely war crimes. Holsey is currently the commander of Southern Command, and has held the post for just over a year, though the typical duration of such an assignment would be three years.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Holsey did not publicly state a reason for his early retirement, but his offer to retire came during a heated meeting about the legality of Caribbean strikes with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and others at the Pentagon on October 6.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;div&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Costco is suing the Trump regime to recover the money the company has paid in tariffs this year. Other companies are also suing the administration over the tariffs, which are likely to be ruled as illegal.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Supreme court is reviewing the regime&#39;s claim that it has the authority to levy tariffs without approval from Congress under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). The IEEPA allows the president to regulate imports during a national emergency, but it is unlikely that imposing tariffs qualifies as regulating imports.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;DOGE&#39;s army of unqualified techno-saboteurs didn&#39;t go away when Elon Musk stepped down from DOGE to secure his trillion-dollar benefits package from TESLA. Instead, they &quot;burrowed into the agencies like ticks.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The embedded DOGE operatives have slowed down their initial blitz-style assault on the institutions of democracy, but they haven&#39;t fundamentally changed their tactics. Mass firings, dissolving contracts, insecure data-sharing, and replacing a public-service mindset with private sector greed are dead giveaways that DOGE is still fully operational, and is employing the same tactics Musk used when he butchered Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;

        Attacks on survivors of Venezuelan drug boat bombing constitutes a war crime &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boat-strike-sept-2-trump-administration-statements/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On September 2, the U.S. Navy destroyed a boat in international waters. The boat was alleged to be a Venezuelan drug boat, though no evidence of this claim has been provided. This was the first in a string of attacks on civilian vessels in international waters.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It has recently come to light that the first boat was struck a second time under the direct order of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, killing the survivors of the first attack. According to the United States&#39; own law of war, attacking &quot;wounded, sick, or shipwrecked&quot; sailors is prohibited, as these no longer pose a threat to U.S. forces. Hegseth is denying ordering the second strike, and is letting Vice Admiral Frank &quot;Mitch&quot; Bradley, who was in charge of the operation, take the blame.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime, never daunted by such pesky things as laws, claims that the second strike was necessary to prevent narcotics from being brought into the United States. There are three major flaws with this claim: There is no evidence that these vessels were smuggling drugs or posed any threat to the United States; there is no way these vessels could possibly carry enough fuel to reach the United States, over 1,000 miles away; and once the vessel was struck in the first attack, it was no longer able to reach the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Since this first attack, the United States has struck more than 20 boats, killing more than 80 people. To date, no evidence has been provided to the American public that any of these boats were carrying narcotics or bound for the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: Comey and James cases dropped. Two Guardsmen shot, one killed in D.C. and ICE-stapo ignores less-lethal weapon guidelines. Trump calls for execution of Democrats promoting lawful disobedience while his regime detains a record number of children. A lawyer lists hundreds of Trump&amp;#39;s crimes so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;

        James Comey and Letitia James cases dropped (for now) &lt;a href=&quot;https://apnews.com/article/comey-james-justice-department-5ec1a59d152bc1fd000ade15e20745b5&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A federal judge has dismissed the Trump regime&#39;s cases against Letitia James and James Comey. After Halligan&#39;s disastrous bungling of the case against Comey last week, you might think the cases were thrown out because of something she did wrong, but it wasn&#39;t &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; the cases were handled that was the problem. It was &lt;i&gt;who&lt;/i&gt; was handling them.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;It turns out that Lindsey Halligan&#39;s appointment to the position of US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia was unlawful. Halligan was appointed as an interim U.S. attorney by Pam Bondi as ordered by Donny 2-Dolls via social media post. But the Attorney General does not have the authority to make such an appointment. Only federal judges in the district in question can make an interim appointment to serve until the vacancy can be filled.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The case against Letitia James could be restarted once the US Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia is properly appointed, but the statute of limitations has expired in the case against James Comey, meaning there can be no further indictment.&lt;/p&gt;

        Two National Guard members shot, one killed in Washington D.C. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/national-guard-shooting-white-house-b2873256.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

            Right: U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe, West Virginia National Guard Airmen shot on November 26. He is currently in critical condition.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Two members of the National Guard were shot this week in Washington D.C. Both were critically wounded and taken to the hospital. One of the victims, U.S. Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, has died from her injuries. The other victim, U.S. Air Force Staff Sergeant Andrew Wolfe remains in critical condition at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The shooter, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, was detained after being shot and injured by guardsmen. He is an Afghan national who immigrated to the United States in 2021 when the US pulled out of Afghanistan. Lakanwal is one of tens of thousands of Afghan allies who worked with the CIA and military in the fight against the Taliban who were resettled in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The exact motives of the shooting are uncertain at this time, though it is believed that the shooting was the act of one individual and not part of a larger threat. But the Trump regime is using the shooting to expand their rhetoric about the dangers posed by immigrants. Even though immigrants are statistically less likely to commit crimes than citizens, the Trump regime has used its xenophobia to blame immigrants for everything wrong with this country, and now they are calling for the expulsion of legal immigrants from at least 19 unnamed countries deemed to be &quot;high-risk.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Pastor Jorge Bautista was leading a prayer when an armed agent approached hiw with a large caliber weapon. Bautista said, &quot;We come in peace.&quot; The agent&#39;s response was to shoot him in the face at close range with a chemical agent, sending Bautista to the hospital for treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While less lethal weapons are designed to break up mobs without the use of lethal force, these weapons can&amp;mdash;and do&amp;mdash;cause severe injuries and can even result in death. Federal guidelines prohibit targeting the head, neck, throat, or spine when using these weapons, and to avoid deploying them near moving vehicles or children. But ICE-stapo agents and other Trump regime goon squads have been blatantly violating these guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Dozens of cases have been recorded of agents deliberately targeting the heads and necks of non-violent protesters, media members, and bystanders who posed no obvious threat. Yet these agents are not held accountable for their brutality.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You would figure they would be trained to de-escalate situations, right? Instead of going straight for using some kind of weapon to assault somebody.&lt;/p&gt;

        Trump regime accuses Democrats of sedition and calls for their execution...for reiterating the law &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/24/pentagon-says-it-is-investigating-us-senator-over-illegal-orders-video&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-content&quot;&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, American service members are &lt;i&gt;required&lt;/i&gt; to refuse to obey illegal orders. Since the founding of our nation, our military members have been expected to use their judgment to distinguish between lawful and unlawful orders from their superiors, and can be held accountable for any unlawful actions that they take, even under direct order. This is because we believe our soldiers are capable of understanding which orders are legal and which are not.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After World War II ended, Hitler&#39;s sycophant&#39;s were hunted down and tried for war crimes. They all tried to excuse their actions by claiming that they were &quot;just following orders.&quot; But that was not recognized on the world stage as a valid excuse for their blatant war crimes. Since that time, our military (like many others) has expended great effort to ensure that our service members know that they have an &lt;i&gt;obligation&lt;/i&gt; to disobey unlawful orders.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Last week, six veterans serving in Congress posted a video in which they each reminded active duty service members that they not only &lt;i&gt;can,&lt;/i&gt; but &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; disobey unlawful orders.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime&#39;s response was to call these members of Congress seditious and publicly call for their trial and execution. That&#39;s right: Donald Trump&amp;mdash;the same man who pardoned criminals &lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jan/24/trump-pardon-proud-boys-enrique-tarrio&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tried, convicted, and sentenced&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt; for seditious conspiracy&amp;mdash;is now accusing sitting members of Congress of the same crime, though they did nothing other than post the following reminder of the &lt;i&gt;standing laws&lt;/i&gt; of our nation.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This year, ICE-stapo agents have sent over 600 &lt;i&gt;children&lt;/i&gt; into the federal shelter system. That&#39;s more than the previous four years, &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;combined,&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and more than any other single year in history. The Trump regime is targeting immigrant families, detaining parents and hauling their children off to shelters.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In Donny 2-Dolls&#39; first term, border agents made a practice of detaining adults and separating them from their children who were then detained in federal &quot;shelters.&quot; He stopped the practice after a massive public outcry and a lawsuit. But this year, he brought it back...with a vengeance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The only difference is that now, instead of separating immigrant families at the border, Trump goon-squads are invading cities all across the country, rounding up friends and neighbors from our communities on the flimsiest pretexts they can come up with. If these detainees cannot offer immediate proof of their legal status, they are detained and their children are dumped in federal shelters. They are also making it harder than ever before for relatives or sponsors to get those children back again, with the average time spent in these &quot;shelters&quot; six times longer than it was during Biden&#39;s presidency.&lt;/p&gt;

Unqualified Trump regime attorney mishandles Comey case, 97% of ICE detainees in Chicago have no criminal record, and White House offers MBS red-carpet welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Donny 2-Dolls continues to call the Epstein files a Democrat hoax, but has now signed a bill into law requiring the DOJ to release all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein within 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For months, the Trump regime has adamantly refused to release these files, fighting tooth and nail to keep the documents classified, drawing ire from Republicans as well as Democrats. They officially lost the fight with the election of Adelita Grijalva to the House of Representatives because she promised she would provide the final signature needed on a petition to force a vote on releasing the files. Mike Johnson delayed her swearing-in for weeks in a desperate attempt to delay the signing of this petition, but eventually had no choice but to swear her in.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Upon realizing that Congress would inevitably vote to release the files, Donny 2-Dolls reversed his position and told his bootlickers that they should vote to release the files. Ever loyal to their Fuehrer, they did not disappoint. The House voted 427-1 to pass the bill, and the Senate passed it unanimously.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is expected that the Trump regime will try to exploit a loophole that allows Pam Bondi to withhold or redact documents that jeopardize an active federal investigation or national security. Donny 2-Dolls has already ordered Bondi to open an investigation into Epstein&#39;s associates, and this investigation will probably be used as an excuse to withhold incriminating files. Our prediction: before the year is out&amp;mdash;even while withholding the majority of the documents under this loophole&amp;mdash;Donny 2-Dolls will be taking sole credit for releasing the files and claiming that makes him the most transparent president the world has ever known.&lt;/p&gt;

            Marjorie Taylor Greene to resign in January &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/marjorie-taylor-greene-resign-congress-trump-b2870288.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;div class=&quot;blob-content&quot;&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Noted conspiracy theorist Marjorie Taylor Greene has been one of the Trump regime&#39;s strongest supporters. She frequently appeared on stage with Donny 2-Dolls at his campaign rallies wearing her MAGA hat and singing Trump&#39;s praises.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;But Greene ultimately failed Trump&#39;s loyalty test when she refused to toe the party line on the genocide in Gaza and the release of the Epstein files. True to his nature, Donny 2-Dolls went from praising Greene to chastising her to openly threatening her. He called her a traitor and a ranting lunatic for saying that he should release the Epstein files, even though a week later he ordered all Republicans to vote to release the files.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Greene seemed surprised that Donny 2-Dolls would turn on her, despite the fact that he has never treated his supporters any better than his enemies. Let this be a little life lesson to Greene: If you&#39;re going to cheer for a bully, don&#39;t be surprised if he turns around and starts to bully you.&lt;/p&gt;

        Trump regime&#39;s bungling could cause massive corporate losses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/penny-shortages-causing-big-legal-business-headaches-in-much-of-us/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;For years, the United States has been considering abandoning the penny because it costs more to mint that it&#39;s worth. Other countries facing similar issues have opted to make their low-value coins out of cheaper materials or eliminate them altogether. But either way, they planned for the inevitable consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Not the Trump regime, though. They just decided to stop minting the penny, and provided no explanations, nor any rules or guidelines for how future transactions should be handled. Many states have laws saying credit card customers can&#39;t be charged less for a purchase than cash customers, so businesses can&#39;t just round up their transactions to the nearest nickel without facing potential lawsuits. And if they round all their transactions down, they stand to lose millions of dollars in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Then there&#39;s the banks...if they cash a check and don&#39;t have exact change, they are required to round &lt;i&gt;up,&lt;/i&gt; not down so they don&#39;t short-change the customer. Same goes for businesses that pay employees in cash.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;And on, and on, and on, all throughout our already-crumbling economy.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;blockquote&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;They just said &#39;Let&#39;s get rid of it&#39; and moved on, but they&#39;ve created a train wreck...&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s been no announcement as to why, This was done without any planning or forethought as to what would happen and how it would cascade through the economy.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Back in September, Donny 2-Dolls ordered US attorney Erik Siebert to bring criminal charges against former FBI Director James Comey for lying to Congress. But Siebert found insufficient evidence to file charges against Comey and eventually resigned before he could be fired. Trump then replaced him with a completely unqualified insurance lawyer named Lindsey Halligan, who has no experience prosecuting criminal cases and apparently not enough integrity to turn down the appointment she is woefully unqualified for.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;While seeking a grand jury indictment of Comey, Halligan showed &quot;a disturbing pattern of profound investigative missteps,&quot; according to Judge William E. Fitzpatrick. As a result of Halligan&#39;s bungling, Fitzpatrick has had to go to extraordinary lengths to provide Comey&#39;s defense team with all grand jury materials pertaining to the case. This information is typically sealed until the trial commences, but Halligan&#39;s mistakes jeopardized the integrity of the proceedings and could potentially be viewed as misconduct, which may lead to the entire case being thrown out without a trial.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Trump regime has repeatedly claimed that their extreme anti-immigrant policies are laser-focused on getting the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; criminals out of our country. But the facts tell a different story.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Of the 600 individuals still being detained after months of brutal raids across Chicago over the past few months, only 16 (2.6%) had any criminal history at all, and none of those criminal charges included offenses that the Trump regime has previously described as the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; (such as rape and murder).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jeffrey Cummings has stated that he will order the release of these detainees if the government cannot provide compelling information that they pose a credible threat to public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Chicago residents are infuriated over the violent ICE raids in their communities. They have watched their neighbors, including school teachers, childcare providers, and day laborers, targeted and disappeared in front of their eyes. This includes US citizens, legal residents, and undocumented immigrants who are in the US legally awaiting court cases.&lt;/p&gt;

        Trump rolls out red carpet for Saudi prince suspected of ordering the murder and dismemberment of a Washington Post journalist (among others) &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-welcomes-mbs-saudi-crown-prince-white-house/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-content&quot;&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Mohammaed bin Salman, crown prince of Saudi Arabia, recently visited the White House for the first time since the CIA determined that he ordered the gruesome murder and dismemberment of Washington Post journalist and human rights advocate Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 (and committed other human rights violations). But the Trump regime literally rolled out the red carpet to welcome the prince into the White House.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a reporter asked bin Salman about his involvement in the murder of Khashoggi, Donny 2-Dolls interrupted, accusing the reporter of promoting fake news and brushing off Khashoggi&#39;s murder by saying &quot;A lot of people didn&#39;t like that gentlemen that you&#39;re talking about. Whether you like him or didn&#39;t like him, things happen.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Bin Salman handled the question more politely and diplomatically, stating that Khashoggi lost his life for no purpose and that Saudi Arabia has taken steps to prevent such a thing from happening again. He has previously denied involvement in the murder, though he also stated that he takes full responsibility for the act as a leader in the Saudi government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: Epstein files vote imminent. Democrats snatch defeat from the jaws of victory (again) while Noem profits off of taxpayer ad spending. Trump regime pardons are abuse of power. What really happened in Portland?&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;div class=&quot;blob&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;blob-title&quot;&gt;
        Fight over Epstein files roars back to life as government shutdown ends &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.democracynow.org/2025/11/13/adelita_grijalva&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Image by &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixabay.com/users/stevepb-282134/?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=948442&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Steve Buissinne&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://pixabay.com//?utm_source=link-attribution&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=image&amp;utm_content=948442&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Pixabay&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;After the Democrats gave up on the American people and gave the Republicans everything they wanted while receiving nothing substantial in return, the government shutdown has ended, and the House of Representatives will now return to work after a 7-week fully-paid and completely unjustifiable vacation. Which means they finally had to swear in Arizona Representative Adelita Grijalva. And &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; means that she was able to add the 218th signature to a discharge petition to force a vote on the release of the Epstein files.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Next week, the House of Representatives will vote on whether or not they will require the Department of Justice to release all documents related to Jeffrey Epstein. Currently, it looks like the vote is quite likely to pass, as the Republican party is decidedly split over the issue and most Democrats likely to vote yes.&lt;/p&gt;

        Democrats hand yet another victory to Trump regime &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/11/10/us-senate-nears-vote-on-bill-to-end-40-day-government-shutdown&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;[Link&lt;span class=&quot;bi bi-link-45deg&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After voting 14 times to reject the Republican continuing resolution to fund the government on the grounds that they would not consider a bill unless the Republican party was willing to extend tax credits for the Affordable care Act for 20+ million Americans to prevent their insurance premiums from doubling or tripling in 2026, several Democrats gave up and agreed to reopen the government without any such extension. This just 5 days after the election showed overwhelming support for the Democratic Party while it held the lines against the Trump regime.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The new continuing resolution proposes holding a vote on extending the ACA tax credits at some point in the future (likely after the open enrollment period has closed and Americans are stuck with their new premium increases). Why anyone would agree to just the idea of holding a vote on a purely partisan issue when Republicans have a majority of representation in both the House and Senate is beyond comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

                &lt;p&gt;Homeland Security has spent more than $200 million of taxpayer funds to film a television ad featuring Cosplay Barbie Kristi Noem at Mount Rushmore. The law requires the government to engage in a competitive bidding process that is intended to prevent corrupt politicians from awarding government contracts exclusively to their own businesses or their cronies.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;But Noem&#39;s Homeland Security department bypassed that law on the frequently-disproven claim that immigration constitutes a &quot;national emergency&quot; and awarded the contract so that one of the beneficiaries was a consulting firm with personal and business ties to Noem. Then they hid that information from public records about the contract by listing a phantom company that was formed just days before the deal was finished.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;Whether or not there is a national emergency that forgoes the need for competitive bidding, the law is very clear in forbidding conflicts of interest in government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Donny 2-Dolls has been using his powers to grant clemency to benefit his own supporters, donors, and fellow felons. From insurrectionists to fraudsters to money launderers, the only requirement for a Trump pardon appears to be offering him loyalty or financial gain.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the established procedure for requesting a presidential pardon has been mostly ignored. Those who are following established Justice Department rules in their requests for pardons are ignored, while those who end up with a pardon usually never even went through the established process. After pardoning Binance founder Changpeng Zhao, Trump admitted that he didn&#39;t even know him, and only pardoned him because &quot;a lot of people asked me to.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The pardons not only erase the criminal record of the recipients. They also erase any judgments of restitution. Estimates are that the pardons issued over the past 10 months have erased more than $1.3 billion in restitution owed to victims of the crimes being pardoned.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Trump regime has claimed that deploying National Guard troops to Portland was necessary because  ICE facilities were facing &quot;coordinated assault by violent groups,&quot; leaving the city &quot;war-ravaged&quot; and in desperate need of government assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Evidence shows that in the months leading up to the deployment of the troops to Portland, protesters did clash with counter-protesters, and the police were called in to disperse the crowds. But police were well-equipped to handle the clashes that took place and rarely even made any arrests. No evidence could be found indicating any type of coordinated assault. In fact, after reviewing the case, a federal judge has blocked the deployment of the National Guard to Portland temporarily, until proof can be provided that there is an active rebellion or risk of rebellion against the government or government officials.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Further investigations seem to indicate that most of the violence experienced in Portland came from excessive use of force by police officers. Similarly, masked federal officers have repeatedly been seen using brutality against people who clearly posed no threats to them. In addition, the incidences of violence were notably declining prior to the deployment of the National Guard.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;The trial testimony produced no credible evidence of any significant damage to the ICE facility in the months before the President’s callout and no credible evidence that ICE was unable to execute immigration laws.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: Encouraging election results and jury finds &amp;quot;Sandwich Guy&amp;quot; not guilty of assaulting a federal officer. Government shutdowns breaks records for longest in history. Trump flaunts his wealth while SNAP benefits expire for the poorest. What is democratic socialism?&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Four of the most significant races in the 2025 elections have been decisively won by Democratic candidates:&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;ol&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;New York City Mayor: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zohran_Mamdani&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Zohran Mamdani&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

			&lt;li&gt;Virginia Governor: &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abigail_Spanberger&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Abigail Spanberger&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
			&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_California_Proposition_50&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;California Prop 50&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Passed&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
		&lt;/ol&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While these elections are encouraging, we do want to point out that this was an off-year election with only a few states or cities that had significant candidates or policies on the ballot at all. Hopefully, these results are a sign that people are fed up with the Trump regime&#39;s assault on American democracy. If this momentum keeps up, it&#39;s entirely possible that the 2026 mid-term elections will significantly change the balance of power in our government.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;On August 10, Sean Dunn was captured on video in a verbal confrontation with a CBP officer in Washington D.C. A frustrated Dunn tossed his Subway sandwich at the officer and was subsequently chased down and detained. He was initially charged with felony assault, but a grand jury refused to indict him on such a ridiculous charge, so the charges were dropped to misdemeanor assault.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Dunn was found not guilty of the equally ridiculous misdemeanor charge in his trial. The defense argued that a sandwich simply cannot be wielded with sufficient force to pose a credible threat to a man wearing- a bullet proof vest.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Dunn has become something of a symbol of the anti-Trump regime, with murals, signs, and banners depicting him throwing a sandwich appearing all around the country.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;This week, the government shutdown officially became the longest in US history by surpassing the previous record, which was set during Donny 2-Dolls&#39; first term.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Democrats continue to demand Republicans negotiate with them&amp;mdash;the historically successful way to end government shutdowns. Republicans, however, have refused to negotiate on any budget issues, and House Speaker Johnson has refused to even conduct the business of the House that he is being paid to conduct during the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The next mayor of New York City is a self-proclaimed Democratic Socialist. So is Senator Bernie Sanders. And Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But what does it mean to be a democratic socialist?&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The simple truth is that, like most political ideologies, there is no single, absolute, definitive definition of the term. There&#39;s lots of room for interpretation and disagreement even among people who identify with the label. Broadly speaking, democratic socialists believe that certain sectors of the economy (such as healthcare, housing, and transportation) cannot provide the public benefit necessary if they are run solely for profit.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The primary purpose of democratic socialism is to curb capitalism&#39;s excesses through progressive reforms that target human rights and dignity over profitability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recap of this week in the revolution: Senate passes resolution to undo Trump tariffs. Kat Abughazaleh targeted by weaponized DOJ and Trump regime to revoke disability benefits. Warships deployed to Venezuela. Updates on the government shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Senate passed a resolution to undo many of the Trump regime&#39;s global tariffs in a 51-47 vote.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The vote was mostly passed by party lines, with all Democrats voting yes, along with 4 Republicans. The resolution nullifies the presidential declaration of a state of emergency that the Trump regime was using to justify its usurpation of Congress&#39;s authority to levy tariffs.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;But don&#39;t get excited. The Senate vote is only one step. The measure would have to be approved by the House (Which has been out of session for weeks because Johnson refuses to swear in the newest representative) and signed by Trump, and that&#39;s not going to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime is charging 6 people, including congressional candidate Kat Abughazaleh, in a federal indictment through the Department of Justice for their actions in protesting the ICE-stapo&#39;s human rights violations taking place in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;This authoritarian tactic is a gross violation of the fundamental rights of all Americans guaranteed by the Constitution. But it&#39;s also a sign that the Trump regime is afraid of Abughazaleh and other popular candidates who dare to oppose them.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;/div&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Trump regime is rewriting the rules that govern who is eligible for disability benefits. The argument they are making is that the changes are necessary to reduce the federal deficit and prop up the failing Social Security system, but funds for disability benefits do not come from these sources. In all likelihood, the changes will only push more people into early retirement, causing even more strain on Social Security, while the money saved would sit in the disability benefits trust, unable to be used for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The changes are likely to have a disproportionate impact on Trump-supporting states, since many of these states have higher-than-average numbers of workers receiving disability benefits. The proposed changes could cause as many as 1.5 million workers to lose their eligibility for disability benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The aircraft carrier &lt;i&gt;USS Gerald Ford,&lt;/i&gt; the largest warship in the United States Navy, is making its way to the Caribbean Sea near Venezuela. Meanwhile, the guided missile destroyer &lt;i&gt;USS Gravely&lt;/i&gt; is docked in Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Venezuealan President Maduro has denounced the United States, calling these deployments and the wanton destruction of Venezuelan watercraft in international waters an attempt by the United States to fabricate an &quot;eternal war&quot; against his country.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To date, the United States has killed at least 43 Venezuelans in international waters, claiming that they are smuggling drugs into the United States, but not offering any evidence to support those claims.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Federal workers nationwide are missing their paychecks while the government remains shut down with no end in sight. Some of these workers still have to show up to work every day, but most do not.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The House of Representatives, on the other hand, continues to be paid. But they aren&#39;t showing up for work, since the House has been out of session since September 19. The Senate convenes a few times a week and votes on the continuing resolution proposed by the House, which they continue to reject.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The standoff continues, and if it continues into next week (which it probably will), it will become the longest government shutdown in the history of the United States. The current record for the longest government shutdown was from December 22, 2018 to January 25, 2019 (during Donny 2-Dolls&#39; first term as president).&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The standoff continues, with Democrats holding out for extensions of healthcare subsidies for the Affordable Care Act to prevent a doubling or tripling of healthcare premiums for millions of Americans. The Republicans refuse to make any concessions or negotiate on a new continuing resolution to get the government funded again.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Due to the shutdown, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits have been cut off as of November 1. This means that, in addition to millions of government workers not being paid, tens of millions of Americans will start to go hungry as the holiday season begins.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Military members did get paid on October 15th and 31st through an illegal allocation of funds that was not authorized by Congress. ICE-stapo agents are also being paid through illegal allocations of funds.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img class=&quot;img-link&quot; alt=&quot;During a government shutdown, the first group that should stop getting paid is Congress-All of them! No republicans, no Democrats, no checks. In fact, they should be fined daily for every day the government stays clased-and that fine should increase every week until they do their jobs.&quot; loading=&quot;lazy&quot; decoding=&quot;async&quot; style=&quot;--img-width:100vw&quot; src=&quot;/images/VrqfdDWJUW-544.webp&quot; width=&quot;544&quot; height=&quot;886&quot;&gt;
